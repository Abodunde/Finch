In the Python code I designed to classify Reddit comments into categories related to veterinarians, medical doctors, or others, I employed a combination of regular expressions and natural language processing techniques. Here's how I structured the solution:

1. Initialization of Regular Expressions:
   - I defined two regular expressions: `medical_doctor_regex` to identify phrases like "medical student" or "nurse", and `veterinarian_regex` for phrases like "vet student" or "vet tech".

2. Supportive Functions:
   - `other_words_check`: This function uses the regular expressions I set up to check if a comment contains specific keywords indicating either a doctor or veterinarian context.
   - **`get_related_keywords`**: Here, I retrieve synonyms and antonyms for a given word using the WordNet database, which helps in broadening the keyword base to include relevant terms, especially useful for filtering out student-related contexts.

3. Main Classification Function - `similarity_check`:
   - I designed this function to expand the keywords by including their synonyms in the comparison. It then computes the similarity between these keywords and each word in the comment.
   - I utilized an NLP library to calculate similarity scores, aiming for a threshold of 0.70 to classify a comment as related to the specified keyword.
   - The function also incorporates `other_words_check` to ensure comments matching excluded criteria (like student-related terms) aren't misclassified.

4. Application of Classification Functions:
   - I applied `similarity_check` to each comment in the DataFrame for both veterinary and doctor-related categories, creating two separate columns that record these classifications.

5. Final Label Assignment:
   - Through the `label_assignment` function, I determined the ultimate categorization of each comment. If both categories indicate a match, the veterinary label is preferred, otherwise, the appropriate single category is assigned, or it defaults to "others" if neither category is matched.

6. Labeling the DataFrame:
   - Finally, I used the `label_assignment` function to assign the definitive label to each comment, effectively categorizing each into one of the three desired groups.

This code that I designed integrates direct keyword matching with semantic analysis to provide a nuanced approach to text classification, enhancing the ability to accurately categorize textual data based on content relevance.
