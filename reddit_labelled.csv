41,ARatNamedClydeBarrow,"As a VA, this makes me so sad for you. Yeah it takes you guys some time to hit your stride, but that’s the same for *everyone*. I would never dream of speaking to a DVM that way. Voicing concerns in a respectful manner and having a discussion is one thing, but to talk to you with such derision is absolutely not okay. It’s far past time for a chat with their supervisor / head doc / PM.

I love my new grad doctors so much! They always like to talk things out with me (I love hearing the trains of thought) and even sometimes ask my opinion if it’s not something they’re super familiar with, but is something I’ve seen before. They love to teach us things they learned in school, it helps solidify concepts for them *and* we probably get to learn something new. I’m losing one of my new grads and I’m super broken up about it, I switched my dog to her when she started and now he doesn’t have a vet.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you’re not comfortable taking the lead, if you’re not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you’re comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don’t go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example… you most likely will get yelled at lol). My newest new grad likes to be a “fetus tech” (his words) and help out for little things if he has the time, and tries to be helpful during emergencies if he’s available because he feels it makes him a better doctor.",va makes sad yeah takes guys time hit stride thats everyone would never dream speaking dvm way voicing concerns respectful manner discussion one thing talk derision absolutely okay far past time chat supervisor head doc pm love new grad doctors much always like talk things love hearing trains thought even sometimes ask opinion something theyre super familiar something ive seen love teach us things learned school helps solidify concepts probably get learn something new im losing one new grads im super broken switched dog started doesnt vet advice emergencies even youre comfortable taking lead youre occupied things try get involved make useful cpr scenarios offer count breathe youre comfortable restraint ivc placement getting hot cold packs needed grabbing supplies u cath pulling emergency drugs etc way observe experienced dvm case without hovering much getting way biggest thing though know ask questions shut dont go full differential main doc trying interpret rads example likely get yelled lol newest new grad likes fetus tech words help little things time tries helpful emergencies hes available feels makes better doctor,0,doctor,doctor

She basically had a card decline on a monthly payment and was FURIOUS. I left her multiple voicemails that we would eat that payment and rectify things and she never called back. Apparently her job is just so extremely important and she’s too busy to call the clinic back idrc. But yeah they all have some sort of entitlement/god complex.

155,spaghetti000s,"Steps to becoming a Radiologist:

Vet school:
x. Be within the top 1/3 of your class in Vet school (4 years)
x. Try and get published while in vet school (even just a case report is incredibly helpful)
x. Get to know your radiology department in vet school; if at all possible try to get a student worker position in the department. Ask questions, don't be annoying, read Thrall textbook as often as you can

Post Vet School:
x. Rotating internship first, choose one that has at least 2 board certified radiologists (need at least two letters of rec from them)
x. if you didn't get published in vet school, you need to do it during the rotating internship
x. Read Thrall on your downtime

Post Rotating Internship:
x. Apply for both specialty radiology imaging internships (1yr) and residencies (3-4yrs) in the same Match cycle; if you don't match to a residency first try (quite rare), hopefully you'll match to an imaging internship. Get published during this internship if you did not in the previous two steps. Read the entirety of Thrall during this internship.

x. Many many people get stuck after rotating and are unable to secure a residency position; its very competitive. It's a mix of good preparation (high GPA, good letters of rec, publications), personality (gotta get along with people for three years in residency so they won't choose an asshole no matter how brilliant you are), and connections (see step 1, getting to know the radiology department at your vet school). Above all, a healthy does of luck.


Why do all of this? Radiology is AWESOME. Most interesting specialty by far, radiologists are the hub of the hospital and get to discuss every interesting case with the top specialists in the hospital. NO owner communication - never get yelled at or make another estimate ever again. Work life balance - arguably the best you'll ever have in this field, you can work from home 100% of the time if you want to, but also amazing flexibility (can work part time from home, part in specialty hospital for example, or go do ultrasounds in local clinics one day a week).

162,Outrageous-Painter,"You can do this by creating multiple container of myst nodes and connect them to the network

Here is a simple python script to use the API to connect to another myst node:

    import requests as r
    import json import os
    url=""http://localhost:4050/""
    providers=r.get(url+""proposals"").json()
    proposals=providers[""proposals""]
    print(proposals[0])
    provider_id=proposals[0][""provider_id""]
    consumer_id=""your consumer id""
    print(provider_id)
    os.system(f""myst cli connect {consumer_id} {provider_id} wireguard dns=system"")

To disconnect you need to do a DELETE call on [http://localhost:4050/connection](http://localhost:4050/connection)

Now your virtual machine has a new network interface called myst.

You can now configure a proxy server in your container to use the myst interface

Here it is the configuration using squid:

    logfile_rotate 0
    http_access allow localnet
    cache deny all
    tcp_outgoing_address 0.0.0.0 all
    dns_nameservers 1.1.1.1
    dns_v4_first on

Now you can use the new server as a proxy connected to the myst network.

I think you can do this in docker too",creating multiple container myst nodes connect network simple python script use api connect another myst node import requests r import json import os urlhttplocalhost providersrgeturlproposalsjson proposalsprovidersproposals printproposals provideridproposalsproviderid consumeridyour consumer id printproviderid ossystemfmyst cli connect consumerid providerid wireguard dnssystem disconnect need delete call httplocalhostconnectionhttplocalhostconnection virtual machine new network interface called myst configure proxy server container use myst interface configuration using squid logfilerotate httpaccess allow localnet cache deny tcpoutgoingaddress dnsnameservers dnsvfirst use new server proxy connected myst network think docker,0,0,others

199,sfchin98,"With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. 

This is not to say you need to match that, given your circumstances, and you’d be surprised how many vets are willing to work for straight salary, but you probably still need to be able to pay $120-150K depending on experience. 

If you are a 501(c)(3) organization then new grads working for you should qualify for federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which is effectively a six figure bonus at the 10 year mark, paid for by the federal government. I would double check with your lawyer/accountant before making it a prominent part of your recruiting. 

I would probably focus a lot of your recruiting at Oregon State, on the assumption there is some population of students there who are from Oregon, want to remain in Oregon, and are paying in-state tuition so they have a slightly lower loan burden. Those vet students also are less likely to be weighing offers from low cost of living areas like Oklahoma or Tennessee where $120K goes a lot farther. 

The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.",understanding reddit post job ad biggest immediate red flag competitive wage everyone says ive never seen job ad declares salary competitive theres shortage vets inundated recruiting emails uncommon us simply deleteignore ads dont list actual salary range reference average new graduate making k average vet salary overall around k oregon cost living higher national average youre going get discount location including production would bet unusual vets making k say need match given circumstances youd surprised many vets willing work straight salary probably still need able pay k depending experience c organization new grads working qualify federal public service loan forgiveness effectively six figure bonus year mark paid federal government would double check lawyeraccountant making prominent part recruiting would probably focus lot recruiting oregon state assumption population students oregon want remain oregon paying instate tuition slightly lower loan burden vet students also less likely weighing offers low cost living areas like oklahoma tennessee k goes lot farther major red flag see vets near retirement age fairly presumption vet clinic retirement age vets practicing date medicine even comfortable substandard unlikely successfully integrating newer technologies procedures practice perhaps especially true clinic primary serving low income client base additional drag recruiting new grads often looking additional mentoring midcareer vets rather nearretirement vets sure address issue,0,0,others

252,According-Anybody-91,"Short form in case you go for the to tldr below:

1. Avoid corporate if at all possible
2. Consider working as an assistant at a clinic/hospital for experience before making any huge commitment. Get hands on experience, talk with people directly in the field, and maybe see human behaviour at its finest. 
3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo. 

That being said...

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it. The new grads that have left the industry the fastest, that I've known and witnessed, started  in corporate (this was Houston, TX and Halifax, NS, so these were not a localized experiences). 

I recently left vet med after 15 years. Again, there's obviously a huge experience difference between a vet and a vet-tech, but I think it helps to hear from the second line. Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations. My favorite job was purchased by corporate (I wasn't there at the time because I had moved to Canada shortly before), and now all I hear about are all of the changes that are for the worse. One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything.

259,chompomonim,"This is a very good catch and a problem we discussed a lot internally during the last half a year.  


Mysterium always wanted to have hundreds of thousands exit nodes. In such case, banning all of them is not that easy, because new ones will always appear in the network. So if corporations would try to ban Mysterium network they would also ban own users. That's why mysterium’s residential nodes are already being used by 5 centralised VPNs as well as in two dVPN applications.  


To acquire hundreds of thousands exit nodes we’re working on “dual-mode” solution, when Mysterium desktop app users could click a button and start providing Mysterium services in the same time. All they’ll  earn will be toppet into their account balance so technically they will have “free VPN credits” for own usage.  


However governments already proved that they can afford to ban even millions of foreighn residential IP addresses, so entering into the Mysterium network from those censorship heavy countries may be complicated.  


Vlad, our lead protocol architect already created a few improvement proposals on how to approach this problem in a good way. This is quite a big part of Mysterium 2.0 engineering innovation. In general there are two main approaches to this solution.  


1. Don’t allow to fetch all the IP addresses. It should be both expensive and even not possible to do from similar IP range. This would allow bots (both corporations and governments) to fetch only part of a network's IPs and pay for that in the same time.
2. Introduce censorship resistance component into network which would serve as entrance proxy into network. So even if exit nodes would be banned by ISP, this “censorship resistance component” would allow people to join network and then jump into one of exit nodes.",good catch problem discussed lot internally last half year mysterium always wanted hundreds thousands exit nodes case banning easy new ones always appear network corporations would try ban mysterium network would also ban users thats mysteriums residential nodes already used centralised vpns well two dvpn applications acquire hundreds thousands exit nodes working dualmode solution mysterium desktop app users could click button start providing mysterium services time theyll earn toppet account balance technically free vpn credits usage however governments already proved afford ban even millions foreighn residential ip addresses entering mysterium network censorship heavy countries may complicated vlad lead protocol architect already created improvement proposals approach problem good way quite big part mysterium engineering innovation general two main approaches solution dont allow fetch ip addresses expensive even possible similar ip range would allow bots corporations governments fetch part networks ips pay time introduce censorship resistance component network would serve entrance proxy network even exit nodes would banned isp censorship resistance component would allow people join network jump one exit nodes,0,0,others

302,G000dawgs,"I do not have any suggestions for what you’re asking for. I’m still working in private practice but hope I can help somewhat. 

There are a few threads in these subreddits about nonclinical vet jobs. I believe you can look up government jobs through the AVMA website. People have also mentioned working for food and pharmaceutical companies, but I do not know how available those jobs are in your area. 

Based on what you wrote, I hope you find any new job asap. Even if it’s in a completely different field. Or just working at a different veterinary clinic. It doesn’t have to be a job that you’ll have to stay at for life. Just get something now that you’re not miserable at. Take care of yourself. And if you haven’t heard of [NOMV](https://www.nomv.org) check their site out. 

I have personally worked at a job that I dreaded going to. It was for different reasons than you mentioned. But I too was actively looking at ways to leave clinical practice while working there. I used what I hated at that practice to find a position at a practice that was the polar opposite. It was healing for me. 

It is expected for a veterinarian, that is new to a practice, will not generate much revenue their first year. Especially if they’re a new grad. I haven’t worked in a rural area, but I imagine the revenue working there is lower than HCOL urban areas. It is expected that as you get used to a clinic and build your clientele, that your revenue will increase. 

It does not sound like you have good mentorship where you are at. I find having a good mentor is crucial for when you’re starting out. I did an internship my first year with 100% supervision and it helped immensely because I could go through my cases with someone experienced. There are practices out there where doctors will provide mentorship. Maybe interview at other jobs that are hiring and ask if they have the capability for this. If they say they do, make sure to do a few working interviews so you can make sure you’re able to get the support you need. 

This is a field that you’re expected to grow in. A newer vet is not going to have the experience or expertise that a seasoned vet has. You’re not a bad vet, you’re just new and it doesn’t sound like you have help. I am constantly trying to learn and improve. Helps me be a better vet and to keep me from getting bored. You’re going to have to get more help in the beginning. I was on VIN CONSTANTLY my first few years out and I still use it on a regular basis ten years out. Keep studying every night. If a case was challenging, research into it more when you have time later. If your clinic uses ANTECH/IDEXX, call and talk to the Internal Medicine specialists at the lab to help you with the bloodwork you submitted. 

I hope you find something that works for you!!!! Good luck!!",suggestions youre asking im still working private practice hope help somewhat threads subreddits nonclinical vet jobs believe look government jobs avma website people also mentioned working food pharmaceutical companies know available jobs area based wrote hope find new job asap even completely different field working different veterinary clinic doesnt job youll stay life get something youre miserable take care havent heard nomvhttpswwwnomvorg check site personally worked job dreaded going different reasons mentioned actively looking ways leave clinical practice working used hated practice find position practice polar opposite healing expected veterinarian new practice generate much revenue first year especially theyre new grad havent worked rural area imagine revenue working lower hcol urban areas expected get used clinic build clientele revenue increase sound like good mentorship find good mentor crucial youre starting internship first year supervision helped immensely could go cases someone experienced practices doctors provide mentorship maybe interview jobs hiring ask capability say make sure working interviews make sure youre able get support need field youre expected grow newer vet going experience expertise seasoned vet youre bad vet youre new doesnt sound like help constantly trying learn improve helps better vet keep getting bored youre going get help beginning vin constantly first years still use regular basis ten years keep studying every night case challenging research time later clinic uses antechidexx call talk internal medicine specialists lab help bloodwork submitted hope find something works good luck,veterinarian,doctor,veterinarian

308,thenoobient,"Hi, thanks for the responses. Let me answer, too.

Ports: like I mentioned, there's no documentation whatsoever. I don't really understand how you consider those ""strong points"". Port 4449 is not once explained. I can obviously figure out it's the web UI port since somewhere on the site it instructs me to open http://ip:4449, but that's it, it's just some implicit information. Regarding those ""UDP ports"", there's also zero explanation, just that ""you should open them"". What range? No info. What are they for? No info. And the rest of those ports that the Myst daemon listens on, again, zero docs. How is that a strong point? And how do I verify my node is working? Because that ""Test"" function on the website definitely doesn't help much...

Firewall: I think here might be some misunderstanding. I'm not talking about my router's firewall, I'm talking about the firewall of the OS that runs Myst. The server itself runs in the cloud at a VPS provider. There's no ""UPnP"" involved as there's no NAT either. There's only firewalld, which won't open ports on its own. And I can't really accept the ""this is for home users"" argument, as the Onboarding page clearly has a dedicated section for _data centers_. And obviously I've been talking about that very scenario.

Purchase: I know the purchase itself is on a separate site, **but** that site is redirecting to your unsecured instance upon completion. Which, again, due to lack of domain name or HTTPS, is completely unreliable. Also what I mentioned, it couldn't even credit my purchase due to some random (undocumented) port not being open. It only credited my MYST the moment I disabled the firewall. Till then, it showed ""0.00000 MYST"" or something. I really don't think managing payments and credit cards should be done via your freshly installed Myst node.

Deb: again, if the project (also) aims for the data center, this argument isn't really valid. Either support the data center, or don't :) And yes, I know, I can run Docker in an EL VM, and map ports, and mount volumes to make a non-persistent construct somewhat persistent, I just fail to see the point.

315,Few-Depth-3039,"Hello, ex Guelph student that had a clear shot into Dvm program and didn’t even end up applying. I originally wanted to be a vet to help animals, kinda not the biggest fan of people but will work with animals happily. Got a job for the experience and worked there for my whole undergrad. Could not wait to quit. By the end, I really couldn’t stand vet med. was just looking for a job where people aren’t exploited and everything is about the love of animals- it’s not. I went home daily depressed over how many bad owners there are or that people are paying crazy amounts for medications for their pet. The pharma industry along with terrible people ruined the industry for me. It’s super hard work, and while it’s rewarding if you like being mentally stimulated all the time, but it’s not rewarding to your pockets. Vets aren’t rich, school is very expensive, and none of the vet staff are paid fairly for the work they do. It’s really an industry of people who love animals but need to deal with a whole lot of roadblocks to show that love. One client that never left my head was a lady with a kitten with a life threatening disease, not incurable but not 100% effective and very expensive. Screw you pharma patent holders!! She didn’t have the money, called every single day to tell us her kitten was dying and it’s our fault for not helping her and we are kitten murderers. She had options- pet care loan with no interest, give kitten up to someone who can take care of it, family/friends, anything? Because nothing was not an option, unfortunately it was the one she made. Pets are belongings by law, so nothing we could do. If we paid out of pocket for every person who came in unable to afford care then there would be no business or pet care. People who can’t afford their pets need to stop! I remember a client wanting us to put her 6 year old dog healthy sweet dog down because they were expecting a baby and couldn’t find them a new home. Tired of hearing people lose their cats outside when that’s not even legal in Ontario and die so stupid fast to car, coyote or kidnapping. And are invasive species?? I never cared for the money, but this career had one hell of an impact on my mental health. Please work at a clinic during school while doing another degree you also have interest in would be my biggest advice. I got my job really easily by expressing my interest in animal care studies- hand your resume in in person. Even though it wasn’t for me, if you have thick skin and can handle seeing and not being able to do anything then go for it.

372,BytesHQ,"Hey! Sure thing.

MYST is the utility token at the heart of Mysterium Network. It's used for P2P micropayments within the network. If you’re using the MysteriumVPN, you can pay with MYST token. If you’re a node (provider of the VPN service) you receive MYST. Jaro actually designed our unique Layer 3 micropayments infrastructure, called the Hermes protocol, to enable these fast, anonymous, and censorship-resistant transactions between network peers.

Our upcoming tokenomics model re-energises MYST and supports the growth of the network and the development of new use cases. For the Mysterium community, it simplifies payments for users and node runners by introducing DAI stablecoin as the reserve currency, so you're not exposed to market fluctautions.

**Tokenomics 2.0 also adds DeFi and Governance properties to MYST.**

The engine behind the tokenomics model was designed by PARSIQ. Mysterium is among the first projects to integrate their new IQ Protocol. The protocol powers the Mysterium Delegation Pool, a completely **""risk-free, collateral-free solution""** that allows holders to stake MYST and earn rewards in DAI stablecoin.

Node runners stake MYST to run a node. Nodes can also rent MYST from the delegation pool without any upfront capital, and a portion of their earnings can be used as repayment. This DeFi mechanism rewards stakers, growing their stake proportionate to pool size and network traffic.The full Tokenomics 2.0 model will launch sometime in **Q1 2022**. We aim to launch the BETA version of the Mysterium Delegation Pool in the next month or so. This version of the staking pool will enable delegators to **earn rewards in MYST**, as we manage the testnet version of the pool.

**You can read more about Tokenomics 2.0 here.** [https://www.mysterium.network/post/introducing-myst-tokenomics-2-0-powered-by-the-iq-protocol](https://www.mysterium.network/post/introducing-myst-tokenomics-2-0-powered-by-the-iq-protocol)",hey sure thing myst utility token heart mysterium network used pp micropayments within network youre using mysteriumvpn pay myst token youre node provider vpn service receive myst jaro actually designed unique layer micropayments infrastructure called hermes protocol enable fast anonymous censorshipresistant transactions network peers upcoming tokenomics model reenergises myst supports growth network development new use cases mysterium community simplifies payments users node runners introducing dai stablecoin reserve currency youre exposed market fluctautions tokenomics also adds defi governance properties myst engine behind tokenomics model designed parsiq mysterium among first projects integrate new iq protocol protocol powers mysterium delegation pool completely riskfree collateralfree solution allows holders stake myst earn rewards dai stablecoin node runners stake myst run node nodes also rent myst delegation pool without upfront capital portion earnings used repayment defi mechanism rewards stakers growing stake proportionate pool size network trafficthe full tokenomics model launch sometime q aim launch beta version mysterium delegation pool next month version staking pool enable delegators earn rewards myst manage testnet version pool read tokenomics httpswwwmysteriumnetworkpostintroducingmysttokenomicspoweredbytheiqprotocolhttpswwwmysteriumnetworkpostintroducingmysttokenomicspoweredbytheiqprotocol,0,0,others

So you would need to supply different arguments for the `config-dir`, `script-dir`, `data-dir` and `runtime-dir`. You may also need to sort out something with the keystore, but that's not as immediately obvious.

If you're running on a systemd-based distro, you'll also need to make copies of the systemd service file, referencing each new set of config options.

My advice would be that you ought to try docker, as I'm not convinced any ""enterprise"" server worth it's salt would not support virtualization, unless its very old, but I also wouldn't consider docker a traditional virtualization approach, in that it doesn't try to segment memory, or even process spaces from the host OS.

488,ThatGenericGinger,"Agreed. it does seem disingenuous when it comes to transparent and consistent information. Its like when the updates rollout and there isnt even any detail.... it just happens or your node falls off the network. There are ZERO project updates in the community channel. just random puff tweets and disjointed information.  


The payouts have seriously dropped in both number and value since the new year and its approaching the point where it almost not valuable to be running a node and sharing data/bandwidth (this bit needs to be addressed properly and especially this early onto the mainnet)  


My personal issue is with the ""1 node per residential IP"" and their main argument is the ability to burn IP addresses and state its for user transparency and halts decentralisation and then go onto mentioning ""Payouts have been cut because of this"" and this is only now just coming in. I would bet someone has been doing this long term with dozens if not hundred of nodes and has a whale bag and is now trying to lift the price now they have secured their moonbag. (\*\*this is a speculation based on information given\*\*)  


If you really break down the situation and what is being said, Decentralisation happens anyway, it just becomes slighlty clustered and anyone wanting to ""Burn IP addresses"" is either doing something illegal (which puts the honus on you as the node provider) or breaking TOS of a platform they are accessing by doing this. (yes we do understand the internet needs to be freely aceessible around government barriers, this is accepted) So this realistically comes down to not the kind of traffic you want to have on your node. 

  
Then finally getting onto the payment side of things, this seems like the main drive for everything to do with the upcoming removal of multiple nodes on IP addresses with a possibly disingenuous/bias reasoning, which means someone somewhere is pissed that they are earning less and probably have a whale account and have been milking it and expected more milk than sharing (which is actually the issue that destroys projects and decentralisation) and the primary reason the value of the crypto doesnt go up because its being dumped at a big rate somewhere.

503,Witty_Can_3490,"I'm at the end of a DVM/PhD program (epidemiology-focused) and I relate to your experience SO much. I felt so out of place in vet school, and it got particularly bad during 2nd year. It seemed like everyone else was finding their ""thing"" as the curriculum got more clinical, while I felt more and more isolated. I also had similar experiences with faculty telling me I should pursue the clinical route instead of epidemiology/public health. 

I think this is a really common experience among anyone who wants to pursue a ""non-traditional"" route in vet school. Vet schools are full of clinicians and academics, and they don't have great resources to help guide the ""non-traditional"" students, when (in my opinion) those students often need more guidance and support than students taking a more ""traditional"" route. Seeking a career in things like public health, epidemiology, wildlife medicine, etc. is a lot more amorphous than, say, trying to become a surgeon. And that's not to say pursuing other fields isn't incredibly difficult! I have the utmost respect for any general practitioner or specialist. I just mean that you kinda know what you have to do to get there, while those on an ""alternative"" path often don't. 

What helped me the most was seeking out better, more supportive mentors. Spend your summers and externship time exploring careers that you actually ARE interested in, and get to know the people who are actually doing those things. If you feel like you can handle it on top of your coursework, try to find a part-time job doing something that you like (research, necropsies, whatever makes you tick) - this helped me IMMENSELY when I was at my lowest in vet school. 

You are absolutely not alone, and you CAN do a lot with a DVM. Remember that vet school does not represent all of vet med.

544,f4un4,"great advice in this comment section so far! for context i am a ""lead"" veterinary assistant. i essentially got this position by being a jack of all trades at my hospital (we also don't have many CVT's haha, otherwise i am sure there would be a lead technician). don't undervalue things like reception and customer service. learn both the front of house (reception) and back of house (technician) operations. 

honestly it is evident that you are eager to learn-- make sure that your team can also see this same enthusiasm! you are going to do great!  now, not every moment can be a ""teaching moment"", i ask questions as much as i can but i also learned to read the room and know when it was inappropriate for me to ask questions, and rather just help how i can, which frequently means simply restraining the animal and/or monitoring. there is going to be a lot to learn and it will feel like a lot at once, just know that there's definitely a learning curve and you will totally get past it. with each day of experience, you will get better (even if you don't realize!). sure, there were some things i had to go out of my way to study but a lot of what i know came from experience and getting used to the routine of the clinic.

learning your flea and heartworm prevention is huge imo, helping people understand that fleas and heartworms actually can enter gated communities (yup, somebody said that once) and understanding which kind is best for their lifestyle. obviously, follow the guidance of the dr. but frankly techs and assistants have a LOT to do with client education as well, as typically we are the ones who go over patient histories and treatment plans/estimates.

i would also say it is important to learn how to run labs pretty quickly. no one is going to be expecting you to place IV catheters or do blood draws on day one, but to be able to go run things on the machine and/or read the cytology will be super useful. 

one of the few things i had to really study as opposed to learn through experience was the drugs used during surgeries. pre-op/induction drugs vs post-op vs emergency drugs. mainly what you need to know is how what drugs the vet uses will affect your patient, for example some cause bradycardia, some cause them to wake up really hard, etc. this will be important to know if you are monitoring patients, which, not to worry, I don't think they will throw you into!!

anyway, sorry for the yap fest. this is an awesome job and an awesome field. it is hard, don't get me wrong. but you will connect with so many pets and so many people. i am at a point where i have a rapport with pets and their families and it just means the world to me.",great advice comment section far context lead veterinary assistant essentially got position jack trades hospital also dont many cvts haha otherwise sure would lead technician dont undervalue things like reception customer service learn front house reception back house technician operations honestly evident eager learn make sure team also see enthusiasm going great every moment teaching moment ask questions much also learned read room know inappropriate ask questions rather help frequently means simply restraining animal andor monitoring going lot learn feel like lot know theres definitely learning curve totally get past day experience get better even dont realize sure things go way study lot know came experience getting used routine clinic learning flea heartworm prevention huge imo helping people understand fleas heartworms actually enter gated communities yup somebody said understanding kind best lifestyle obviously follow guidance dr frankly techs assistants lot client education well typically ones go patient histories treatment plansestimates would also say important learn run labs pretty quickly one going expecting place iv catheters blood draws day one able go run things machine andor read cytology super useful one things really study opposed learn experience drugs used surgeries preopinduction drugs vs postop vs emergency drugs mainly need know drugs vet uses affect patient example cause bradycardia cause wake really hard etc important know monitoring patients worry dont think throw anyway sorry yap fest awesome job awesome field hard dont get wrong connect many pets many people point rapport pets families means world,veterinarian,0,veterinarian

669,Purity14,"According to your own posts in discord, You currently have special ""corp partners"".These ""corp partners"" send their traffic through only one or two nodes on the network.

No one knows who they are, you wont tell us who they are, and they only use the same specific nodes, always.As such, the majority of the traffic that is passed through the mysterium network is sent through these nodes. (500gb in less than 9 days on one node) Leaving piecemeal for everyone else.

Currently, the only way to access the myst network is via an android app, selecting a node, and then connecting to it.

You dont have a windows app, you dont have an ios, or osx app, or a linux app so how are these partner nodes connecting?Why cant the client that they are using be shared with the public for us to use?The remainder of the traffic is being sent through android apps, which again, is piecemeal.

I am going to go out on a limb here and suggest that mysterium are just running their own datacentre node, funnelling their ""corp partner"" data through the datacentre node, cashing in on the ""corp partner cash"" and then using this money to pay piecemeal to the node runners.

I believe that mysterium is just running a run of the mill VPN service. And that mysterium is just a vanity project.

&#x200B;

Question 1: Can you confirm or deny that you run any sort of nodes yourselves?

Node runners used to earn $50 pcm, then $25 pcm, and now they are lucky if they earn $3 or $4 pcm. The amount of node runners that have left the network is tremendous.

Question 2: What are you looking at doing to retain node runners when they arent even meeting the minimum monthly withdrawal amounts anymore?

Question 3: Node runners are told that in order to get traffic, they need to turn ""whitelisted traffic off"" You actually recommend they do this in discord. This shifts the liability onto the node runner. So that should someone use their node for child porn, they are on the hook for it legally. The solution is to put your node on whitelist to stop this from happening. But whitelisted traffic only comes from partners. And that only goes to specific nodes, so you end up with no traffic. Can you explain how you will end this cycle of liability vs traffic.

Question 4: how are your ""corp partners"" putting almost 100gb of traffic through the ""selected"" nodes per day, what app are they using, when seemingly no other app apart from the android one works?Bonus Question: If they are using something other than the android app, why dont you release it, because it clearly works. Can Corp Partners select a node? Can we see what the corp partner client looks like, with a demonstration of its usage please.

736,etherunit07,"Hello,

Thanks for posting this issue here! I will try to elaborate it in more details.

Firstly, your description about connection failed status is correct, if our monitoring agent (instances checking node accessibility and ability to transfer data) is failing to establish a p2p connection or exchange data packets via VPN tunnel, then it marks node as connection failed on your dashboard. As a result, your service proposals becomes unavailable to our discovery service responsible for announcing proposals to the network participants meaning no usage and tokens in payment.

Usually, with help of node logs our team helps to reconfigure host network in the way it starts working but thats again a highly dependant on your network setup capabilities.

From the first glance at this situation, it looks like traffic is failing to traverse with use of UDP hole punching to your VMs at Proxmox resulting in such outcome.

Technically speaking, Oracle Cloud Free Tier has a policy against mining and crypto, etc...they will ban your account after the 1 year review usually. Cloud Node runners dont earn as much as residential nodes. Check out Mysterium documentation to understand more. For me, I am going to shut my instances down after maybe another 3-4 months so that I have fair enough time before the review period.

Their estimation algorithm then increased the MYST cost for settlement transactions, and your transaction (0xcdc572cff0f3a446d0a4d021b6d7171bd21e280823dcc5f0f73d0a0b8dd00897) was one of those with an overestimated transaction fee before the algorithm corrected 4 transactions later.

879,Asleep_Leopard182,"I can't help with the first bit - as I'm sure there are plenty of others more qualified than myself to provide better advice here.  


However, with the second half around surgeons.  
My best advice here is to come from their position & understanding, and meet that in your advance and behaviour. Being surgeons - they've gone through (likely) a Bachelors, then a 4 year Doctorate, then a 1+ year internship, a 4 year residency, and then spent X number of years in a specialisation. When you have that much education under your belt, sometimes things can seem obvious, or are natural to you (from practice and/or also being held to certain standards), that are not obvious or natural to others, particularly vet nurses, and hospital orderlies (which where I am, can exist from zero formal education, through to bachelors in general surgery), which even at the highest form of training, is about 9 years of education & specificity below that of the surgeon.  


Knowing basic things, being able to predict what comes next, being able to notice the small things, and being consistent & solid in your approach. If they ask for tape - ensuring the tape is the correct length for whatever they're planning to do. Know procedures, so when they ask for suture, you don't have to ask which one (unless it's weird, and alternative & needs a double check - in which case make it clear it's double checking).   


In my experience working with surgeons, it's less so that they're directly aggressive, but it is that they want quality work, to meet the standards they have set not only for you, but for themselves. When they are trying to do complex things, they don't want to have to be worrying about how or who is holding an animal.  


That doesn't excuse the relatively common behaviour of being a stick of dynamite behind the scenes (in which case, I just say move practices - it's not your job to fix them), particularly to those in training - however, ensuring that you are thorough and thoughtful in and about your job should show through. Keep in mind they've probably stood where you're standing at some point, quite a few vets started as vet nurses (and have hours in the job), and it can get very frustrating very quickly if you have to think for two, instead of one (particularly on the basics), particularly if it is the basics they're working on.",cant help first bit im sure plenty others qualified provide better advice however second half around surgeons best advice come position understanding meet advance behaviour surgeons theyve gone likely bachelors year doctorate year internship year residency spent x number years specialisation much education belt sometimes things seem obvious natural practice andor also held certain standards obvious natural others particularly vet nurses hospital orderlies exist zero formal education bachelors general surgery even highest form training years education specificity surgeon knowing basic things able predict comes next able notice small things consistent solid approach ask tape ensuring tape correct length whatever theyre planning know procedures ask suture dont ask one unless weird alternative needs double check case make clear double checking experience working surgeons less theyre directly aggressive want quality work meet standards set trying complex things dont want worrying holding animal doesnt excuse relatively common behaviour stick dynamite behind scenes case say move practices job fix particularly training however ensuring thorough thoughtful job show keep mind theyve probably stood youre standing point quite vets started vet nurses hours job get frustrating quickly think two instead one particularly basics particularly basics theyre working,0,doctor,doctor

903,maighdeannmhara,"rDVM here.

I've had clients who went on their own and said they were transferred. Or clients who have called with something that is obviously an emergency on a Friday 10 minutes before close, and we send them elsewhere directly so they say they were transferred when we haven't physically seen the pet in 2 years. I've had clients who I know were given a ballpark estimate and go anyway only to decline everything due to cost because maybe they mulled it over on the car ride over. I recently sent a client to Hospital Y because Hospital X said they weren't taking transfers, and she showed up at Hospital X anyway, so Hospital X got mad at us. 

The closest ER/specialty hospital to us will only book appointments for clients if we call in a referral first, and they also strongly encourage us to call for ER as well. So we do. We like them and want to have good working relationships.

But they only want doctors calling, not techs, even though most of these calls could easily be handled by techs. I don't know how many times I've sat on hold waiting and how many times I've had to call repeatedly because the specialty scheduling person wasn't available. For emergencies, I also don't expect ER docs to be ready and available to talk on the phone immediately because they have a million more important things to do than talk on the phone. And when we have issues getting through, clients get upset and sometimes decide to just go.

As for cost, there are 4-5 referral options near me, and I can't memorize prices for everything for everyone. Inflation hasn't done us any favors, with how many times prices have changed. When I get that info during a call, I pass it along to the client. Whether they actually listen is out of my control.

It's hard on both ends of the relationship.

908,Varishta,"I would say your first step before pursuing this further should be to spend some time shadowing at a vet clinic. You may fall in love and discover your passion, or you may learn that you hate it just as much as your current job. Working in veterinary medicine is quite different from what most people expect, so I would first see if it even appeals to you in the first place. Loving cats is a great start, but that alone isn’t a good reason to work for a vet. Make sure you’re not putting in a ton of effort to end up right back where you are. 

If you spend some time watching the workings of a vet clinic and want to go for it, there are online courses you can take for both veterinary assistants and veterinary technicians. They are similar but different positions, especially if you are located somewhere that vet techs are required to be licensed. Vet tech comes with better pay and the ability to do more, but also means more schooling and more responsibility/stress. There are legitimate, respected vet tech schools online, but you’ll still need to find a physical clinic to work with and let you learn the physical skills involved in order to complete the program. In general, vet med is a heavily education and science based field, so more education is generally looked upon favorably, so long as it is from reputable sources.

Vet assistant doesn’t require any courses, though online courses exist and may or may not give you a boost at getting a job as an assistant. Many of them are on the job trained, but that’s easier to do if they at least have some background in working with animals. Kennel assistant is similar and also typically on the job trained, however the pay for both of these positions is usually quite low. I would check job listings in your area to see if it’s even financially feasible for you. 

The last bit of advice I have is to also consider finding a non-animal job with a better work-life balance and make volunteering with cats at the humane society or a rescue more of a hobby. Some people make a career out of something they love, and find that it takes a lot of the enjoyment out of it versus when it was a hobby or something they did in their free time. Veterinary professionals have a significantly higher rate of suicide than the general public, one of the highest suicide rates of any profession, because we are all very passionate about animals, but the nature of the job is very physically and emotionally draining. Consider if your mental and emotional health can cope with clients screaming at you and accusing you of personally murdering their dog because they didn’t bring it in soon enough or because the client can’t pay for care, cope with neglectful owners, cope with euthanizing animals that could otherwise be saved, cope with making a mistake that may cost an animal their life, and overall cope with seeing animals suffer on a daily basis. It can be a very rewarding job, but there are days where it will absolutely beat you to the ground and keep kicking while you’re there. This is why I would strongly advise shadowing before deciding if it’s for you or not. There’s nothing wrong with taking a non-animal job and making animals how you decompress in your free time instead.",would say first step pursuing spend time shadowing vet clinic may fall love discover passion may learn hate much current job working veterinary medicine quite different people expect would first see even appeals first place loving cats great start alone isnt good reason work vet make sure youre putting ton effort end right back spend time watching workings vet clinic want go online courses take veterinary assistants veterinary technicians similar different positions especially located somewhere vet techs required licensed vet tech comes better pay ability also means schooling responsibilitystress legitimate respected vet tech schools online youll still need find physical clinic work let learn physical skills involved order complete program general vet med heavily education science based field education generally looked upon favorably long reputable sources vet assistant doesnt require courses though online courses exist may may give boost getting job assistant many job trained thats easier least background working animals kennel assistant similar also typically job trained however pay positions usually quite low would check job listings area see even financially feasible last bit advice also consider finding nonanimal job better worklife balance make volunteering cats humane society rescue hobby people make career something love find takes lot enjoyment versus hobby something free time veterinary professionals significantly higher rate suicide general public one highest suicide rates profession passionate animals nature job physically emotionally draining consider mental emotional health cope clients screaming accusing personally murdering dog didnt bring soon enough client cant pay care cope neglectful owners cope euthanizing animals could otherwise saved cope making mistake may cost animal life overall cope seeing animals suffer daily basis rewarding job days absolutely beat ground keep kicking youre would strongly advise shadowing deciding theres nothing wrong taking nonanimal job making animals decompress free time instead,0,0,others

1071,from_the_box,"Hi there, I’m a 3rd year surgery resident! 
Everything Asleep_leopard said here is true. We’ve been through 12+ years of *you must be perfect to move forward* type education. We have never gotten off easy for a missed thing, so we’re type A and seriously anxious about the minute details because the blame always falls to us. And once we’re in practice… what you do is on our license. 

So, what we want from our team is that level of buy-in. We want you to have pride in doing your job right and understanding that whether you do it right can have an impact on patient survival, complications etc. I have so much knowledge to share, but if I have to keep explaining why it’s important and you don’t want to work to improve your own knowledge to improve our care… I will resent it. I need to trust you. If I can’t see you care and or try to improve, then I won’t trust you and will feel like I have to do it myself for safety purposes. And surgeons like doing surgery, we don’t want to do prep and anesthesia and instrument care but if we can’t trust others to do it we will and then get crusty about it. 

In return for your buy-in, I will fiercely advocate for your wellbeing, work-life balance, pay etc. that might be only me because I believe in balance over profit/cutting that one extra case can’t be an everyday thing. But good teams are worth their weight in gold. Not just figuratively but actually in surgery. Efficiency and quality = money, and I can’t cut without a team to do anesthesia and prep etc. Get paid and get out on time. Older surgeons are often not as good at that part. 

Things you can do… read some texts on surgical sterile prep and instrument care. There’s a whole chapter in Tobias (Veterinary Surgery 2nd edition) on instruments and prep and suture and whole texts on it too. Read about procedures - again, textbooks help here but so do pages online from ACVS or other clinics. There’s a book on local anesthesia if you might be learning blocks. And there are tech courses at ACVS conference and through companies to learn more. If you like surgery, negotiate with your job to send you to them.

1104,Justgivemeanamethen,"Everyone here is right about this being toxic behavior. You need to have a conversation with management about it. 

I’ve worked with a lot of assistants and doctors (as an assistant and manager) in my time in clinics. My experience with this behavior has been this:

1) some assistants/techs are lazy and don’t want to do extra work. So when they say things like “no one else makes us do this” that sounds like lazy staff to me. They may like the other doc because she is happy to take short cuts and “create less work” for them. 

2) how do you act when you are stressed or overwhelmed? I’ve worked with vets who shut down, can’t make a decision, and get snappy when they feel stressed. Those types of reactions can cause the team to question competency. How do you respond when they offer suggestions when you’re stressed? I would get frustrated with vets who are clearly overwhelmed but unwilling to accept my input. (ex. recommending a vet stage other extractions when they are already behind, can’t get good dental rads and there’s a root they can’t get out. only for them to tell me they already got approval from the owner so they have to do it.) 

3) I’d much prefer a doctor do additional work ups than just take the easy way out. I can much easier defend good medicine that irks a client than bad medicine that causes problems for a patient. I think any good tech/assistant would say the same. I do get frustrated when the doctor can’t multi task through it. Are you able to delegate the treatment plan to them and move on to the next patient or are you involved in every step? I’d have some vets that want to draw the blood and start the tests when it would be faster for me to do it. You really need to have trust in them to do that. 

I have also seen staff members who love working with bad vets! Idk why! The one I’m thinking of specifically gossiped with the staff, used the R word several times (and didn’t understand why she couldn’t continue to use it after I coached her) and never bothered to read medical histories.

1146,Otterwut,"I think your position is not an uncommon one. I've seen it many times in real life and seen it on this subreddit even more. I've been working in vet med for 15 years and have worked every position in the hospital at some point. I currently offer my relief services to 5 hospitals and have worked at nearly 20 in my time ranging from small single doctor GP clinics to university ECC. All this to say that, in my experience, this happens to even boarded specialists at any and all levels.

 I've worked with brilliant technicians who I would trust over some doctors and whose advice is absolutely golden. If you have one of those in your clinic then be a sponge and learn all you can from them. Their experience is invaluable and a good tech is a life and license saver. You will make mistakes and they will help you catch them. 

Unfortunately, a substantial amount of the techs/assistants you're working with will not be these people. A large amount of the work force for nurses are on the job trained and have only worked at maybe 1-2 hospitals for a few years. They don't know what they don't know, and I can say this because I went through that gauntlet myself. The more I've learned the quicker I am to pause and think about why someone may have done something they did. There's a good chance the people giving you trouble are the ones who fall in this category. It boils my blood to see how pervasive it is to have nurses who don't even understand why decisions are being made criticize doctors for them. There are multiple boarded specialists I've seen get shit on by nurses who when pressed for more details about exactly what they did wrong could either only provide wrong information, are lacking SIGNIFICANT context clues or base knowledge to even understand what they're judging, or just don't have anything worth while and just like the drama. The people who lack this knowledge are the quickest to judge and those who know the most tend to be more patient and understanding. This has been true for pretty much every single one of my 18 clinics I've worked at. 

My best advice is to see where this advice is coming from. If it's from a trusted source who means well then absolutely forget your ego and absorb anything you can. If it's from the clinic drama queen with the over inflated ego then just ignore it and move on.

1149,Icy_External6132,"Depending on your definition of ""worth"" 

If you're talking about earning ""big money"", being a vet (GP) is not the best option. Of course it is still achievable if you're a specialist. 

To me, it's ""worth it"" as i get to do quite a bit of hands on, and I feel happy from being able to help my patients to recover from illness (not all the cases, but we always do our best). The journey of investigating the root cause of issues may be challenging, but it's definitely worth it, even if it's a bad or good diagnosis. 

Till now (only about 3+ years of working experience), I am constantly learning even during my off days. I join classes, webinars, wet labs...... yes it's tiring but it's worth it as I get to learn new things! 

Dealing with the clients is definitely tiring, and sometimes I may feel it is not ""worth it"" as people tend to turn away due to the cost, or they feel that their pet ""doesn't require the treatment / prevention/ tests"" recommended. I do feel bad for my patient, but in the end, the owner is the one spending, so I have to respect their decision. 

Lastly, occasionally i feel it is not worth it as I overworked. My job is 5.5 days/ week and about 8.5 hours a day, but I usually spend about 10-12 hours depending on my ""to do lists"". 

Dealing with your emotion/ mental health is definitely important. Sometimes I just stay in my room doing nothing (literally nothing, just to get myself rested); sometimes I go for a walk; sometimes I read something (non vet or science related) at a cafe; sometimes I hangout with my friends (talk about life and avoids anything work related)........ you just have to find your own way! 

Good luck!

1174,IndigoCatwoman,"I’m turning 30 in the spring and will graduate my DVM in May so sort of where you’ll be when you finish! The biggest thing to remember is that there’s no race in life and everyone is on their own timeline. Just because someone has a house, kids, etc doesn’t mean they’re further along in life - they’re just on a different path and that’s okay!

Relationship-wise - many of my classmates found relationships, some came in with relationships and are now engaged, some came in with a partner and split up (this is where I fall lol), many just didn’t date at all. I can’t tell you where to find a person that fits into your life - I haven’t yet - but I know they’re out there! 30 is still young, don’t put too much pressure on yourself to have all that stuff figured out when you graduate. (As an aside, I just want to say that it’s also okay to not get married and have kids if you prefer to focus on you!! Lots more people are choosing to be childless and it isn’t selfish to focus on what you want whatsoever!)

I’m not sure what your debt load or economy will be like where you’re living so can’t really speak to that. I personally have six figure debt but am still intending to buy a house when I graduate, you don’t necessarily need to have all your debt paid off to do that but it does depend on a lot of external factors that I can’t really comment on. Many many people have debt throughout their life and are still able to have kids etc - you just may have to live frugally or take a bit longer to pay your debt off (ie have a lower monthly payment).

1198,Able_Stomach_,"Spaying can be a difficult procedure, especially for beginners. Here are some tips and tricks that you may find helpful:

* **Find a mentor:** One of the best things you can do is find a more experienced veterinarian or veterinary technician who can mentor you and guide you through the process. They can answer your questions, provide feedback on your technique, and help you troubleshoot any problems you encounter.
* **Start with small animals:** If you're new to surgery, it's a good idea to start with smaller animals, such as kittens or puppies. This will allow you to gain experience and confidence before moving on to larger animals.
* **Practice on models:** There are a number of surgical models available that you can use to practice your technique. This can be a great way to get comfortable with the instruments and procedures before you operate on a live animal.
* **Watch videos:** There are many great videos available online that can teach you about spaying. Look for videos that are specifically geared towards beginners.
* **Take a course:** There are a number of courses available that can teach you about spaying. These courses can be a great way to learn from experienced professionals and get hands-on experience.

Step into the fear, the unknown! What is the worst that happens? You go back into your old career or find something else if you hate it? At least you won’t have the regret of never knowing. And I’m sure you’ll learn a ton about yourself along the way! Plus, time just keeps going so why not apply yourself to something that you think will be more fulfilling? All we have is time really.

You won’t need to complete another undergraduate degree but certain pre-requisites to apply. Go here: https://www.aavmc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VMCAS_2025_ApplicantGuide.pdf

VMCAS is where you apply and all the information should be in there that you need. You should be able to make a login and browse things through there or just go to the general website. You could also look up specific school requirements online or meet with an advisor at a local college or your previous Alma mater and get some advice on where to start. You’ll need things like chem 1 and 2, orgo, calculus, so I’m sure you’ll have some done already.  While you are working on pre-requisites try to get some experience such as vet assistant work somewhere. You’ll definitely need some experience in order to get in but this being a second career you also have other life and leadership experience that other applicants don’t have. You can also apply to an island school which are probably a little bit easier to get in. More cost, but absolutely amazing experience overall. Absolutely loved living in the Caribbean!

1214,soderstrom_ansa,"I will say i have the same concerns as you, even though I am not in the exact same position. 

I was 21 years old when I entered the vet school. It might not be as bad, but I realized it took us 11 semesters or 5 1/2 years to get the DVM degree  in Indonesia. So I will be at least 26 or 27 when i graduated.

The concerns I had is with how job availability works in Indonesia. This country has a very, very discriminative job requirements regarding the age, and there's no law protecting the citizens from it. Most of the companies here only hire people BELOW 25, while at the same time most of them require the applicants to have an experience in the field at last a year or two. So the anxiety just ramped up when I realized that. I have no experience and I will be older than 25 when I graduate.

But I think being a vet is more than a job, more than an errand to do to get money. I decided to be a vet in a very recent time before I get to the school, yet I already love being a vet student in my 6th semester now. I don't think I wanna be or can be anything other than a vet. If there's no way for me to work in my country, I can just work at another (I guess).

So, I think there's no harm for you to just go and achieve your dream as a vet, especially when age is not a big deal there. I think you'll do just fine being a vet student while also living your adult life.

Cons: the curriculum I'm on is being phased out and a new one is coming in, so it's very much in a transitory state. Seems like the new curriculum is good and is getting people more hands on experience? Hands on experience rn is in the cons column for me, it mostly falls on me to pursue opportunities outside of class. Also my big complaint is disorganization and communication. It often feels like no one is ""driving the car"" and there are just too many siloed services that don't talk to each other or to us lol. Also I do not like Philly that much (expensive and I'm not a city guy) and the split campus thing sucks if you're large animal focused (large animal hospital is an hour outside the city). Oh also we lost our exotics service during the pandemic.

Pros: High quality of professors (sometimes a bad thing bc a person teaching you is too educated to see where common blind spots might be), a lot of them are very good at teaching. Good case load for certain things (shelter med and small animal stuff in general, small animal specialty, standardbred race horses, high level show horses, dairy and pork to some extent).

It represents a more general breakdown of the old-school dynamic between ECC DVMs and rDVMs (in my view); COVID and post-COVID changes in our profession further strained this relationship.

The established dogma essentially works like this: rDVM referral => speciality emergency care => return to rDVM for follow-up ; always with the inherent and assumed professional collegiality (ie. communication) necessary to ensure the patient is receiving the appropriate care - before, during, and after a visit to emergency & critical care. This (in theory) allows for continuity of care and a cyclic, self-referring economic practice that preserves the rDVM-client relationship and preserves the rDVM-ECC DVM relationship.

This is how it should work in practice, but the realities of veterinary medicine in the last 4-5 years has shown erosion of the conventions and practical applications of this system. This system really only works for our patients when everyone (rDVM, ECC DVM) is equally invested in the pet's outcome. For example: 

- if an rDVM evaluates a sick patient and then transfers with no call, no records, and no conversation with an owner - they're essentially both delegating their job to me, and simultaneously making my job harder. In 2 years I've had 10-12 cases where owners arrive clueless to how sick their pet is and clueless to the costs for 2 or 3 days of ICU care, and they've ultimately elected for humane euthanasia after a 5-10 minute conversation. The rDVM also charged the owner a consultation fee, which seems like it should've covered that same conversation. 
- location dependent, but where I am, rDVMs are rarely available for the follow-up necessary to recheck *their own patients*. Discharging a patient from the ICU means they are well enough to go home, not necessarily that they're healthy. Most of these patients need a follow-up within 7-10 days (if not sooner) and rDVMs often seem to struggle getting appointments within 3-4 weeks. Patients requiring open-wound management are a great example - they require bandage changes every 1-3 days, often times for weeks at a time. Emergency & critical care can happily put these animals back together on day 1. But ECC, by definition, doesn't see appointments, we are not meant to be there for the scheduled follow-up care, and it's inappropriate to presume that we are now the animals' primary doctor. Of course, we're often the only choice, so my days commonly involve seeing all the new patients coming in off the street, all the patients being transferred from the rDVM, and sprinkling in the 'recheck appointments' that our patients need. rDVMs should have a very clear understanding of how difficult it is to arrange an appointment in the middle of a schedule that is by default, unpredictable. Is this not the same problem facing our counterparts in human medicine that are overwhelmed with people relying on the ER as their primary care? 

Recognizing a minority of bad apples don't represent the majority of rDVMs - if the perception is rDVMs are not fulfilling their role prior to transfer and after discharge, it makes it really hard to want to play along and coddle the precious rDVM-client relationship, much less maintain any collegial rDVM-ECC DVM relationship. 

- it sometimes feels as if the primary motivation for the rDVM not the outcome for the patient, but rather preserving a VCPR with the client (ie. preserving opportunity for income). Because I actually don't care if the client returns to the rDVM; my motivation is for the best outcome for my patient
- what reason do I have to go out of my way to maintain collegial rDVM relationships, when this is how ECC is treated? I mean, I do anyway, but I'm salty about it. There is no longer an economic motivation to maintain these relationships; in many areas one ECC clinic is the *only choice* - so I'm going to see the ECC patients whether I want to or not, and rDVMs are going to continue referring sick animals to ECC, because they don't have a choice. Alternatively, I welcome rDVMs to feel free to begin treating and working these patients up on their own.",yeah issue everywhere ive worked even majority rdvms everything theyre asked handful dont really stand sorry advance meme triggered vent following represents general breakdown oldschool dynamic ecc dvms rdvms view covid postcovid changes profession strained relationship established dogma essentially works like rdvm referral speciality emergency care return rdvm followup always inherent assumed professional collegiality ie communication necessary ensure patient receiving appropriate care visit emergency critical care theory allows continuity care cyclic selfreferring economic practice preserves rdvmclient relationship preserves rdvmecc dvm relationship work practice realities veterinary medicine last years shown erosion conventions practical applications system system really works patients everyone rdvm ecc dvm equally invested pets outcome example rdvm evaluates sick patient transfers call records conversation owner theyre essentially delegating job simultaneously making job harder years ive cases owners arrive clueless sick pet clueless costs days icu care theyve ultimately elected humane euthanasia minute conversation rdvm also charged owner consultation fee seems like shouldve covered conversation location dependent rdvms rarely available followup necessary recheck patients discharging patient icu means well enough go home necessarily theyre healthy patients need followup within days sooner rdvms often seem struggle getting appointments within weeks patients requiring openwound management great example require bandage changes every days often times weeks time emergency critical care happily put animals back together day ecc definition doesnt see appointments meant scheduled followup care inappropriate presume animals primary doctor course often choice days commonly involve seeing new patients coming street patients transferred rdvm sprinkling recheck appointments patients need rdvms clear understanding difficult arrange appointment middle schedule default unpredictable problem facing counterparts human medicine overwhelmed people relying er primary care recognizing minority bad apples dont represent majority rdvms perception rdvms fulfilling role prior transfer discharge makes really hard want play along coddle precious rdvmclient relationship much less maintain collegial rdvmecc dvm relationship sometimes feels primary motivation rdvm outcome patient rather preserving vcpr client ie preserving opportunity income actually dont care client returns rdvm motivation best outcome patient reason go way maintain collegial rdvm relationships ecc treated mean anyway im salty longer economic motivation maintain relationships many areas one ecc clinic choice im going see ecc patients whether want rdvms going continue referring sick animals ecc dont choice alternatively welcome rdvms feel free begin treating working patients,veterinarian,doctor,veterinarian

I’m 21 now but straight out of high school I went into an Early childhood degree and then in this last year switched to psychology but in these last 4 months I decided to really be true to myself and listen to my gut about being a veterinarian. It came down to being more scared about pursuing a career I wasn’t truly passionate about compared to pursuing the competitive field I was very passionate about. There will be struggles in our futures no matter what career we choose yes vet met comes with many but that passion and gut feeling we feel is there for a reason and we need to listen to it. When it comes down to it it’s not really just about the question of can I do it because honestly and truly we can all do anything we put our minds to. The question is how do you see your future when you are going through the ups and downs in life that are bound to happen. Do you see yourself coming home from work as a veterinarian even though it was a hard day you will be proud of the work or do you see yourself coming home from a job that may not completely fulfill you. Also looking at the bigger picture and diving deeper you need to see why you struggle with that confidence and self doubt just as I do. Somewhere along the way we started doubting ourselves and now we can either continue with those self limiting beliefs or we can prove to ourselves that we can do this. Try to build your confidence day by day by accomplishing the little things for me it’s been keeping active. I’ve been able to prove to myself that I can stick to a routine and it feels good which in turn has been giving me more confidence and allowing me to doubt myself less. You can do it I have complete faith in you and you should have faith in yourself too!! Work on your confidence and push out those self limiting beliefs. At the end of the day we are only on this earth for a short time so just go for it! I wish you all the best!!",completely know feel whole life animals becoming veterinarian somewhere along way guess high school lost confidence gained self doubt guess little see excitement career get older feelings self doubt lack confidence facts means pursue career really hits us im straight high school went early childhood degree last year switched psychology last months decided really true listen gut veterinarian came scared pursuing career wasnt truly passionate compared pursuing competitive field passionate struggles futures matter career choose yes vet met comes many passion gut feeling feel reason need listen comes really question honestly truly anything put minds question see future going ups downs life bound happen see coming home work veterinarian even though hard day proud work see coming home job may completely fulfill also looking bigger picture diving deeper need see struggle confidence self doubt somewhere along way started doubting either continue self limiting beliefs prove try build confidence day day accomplishing little things keeping active ive able prove stick routine feels good turn giving confidence allowing doubt less complete faith faith work confidence push self limiting beliefs end day earth short time go wish best,veterinarian,0,veterinarian

**Some things that helped me to memorize as a new vet assistant:** 

• Where on the animal the vaccine is administered and at what age (does it have a booster, how many years is it good for, are there choices for the owner to make, etc.). The hardest appointments as a new vet assistant are new clients/pets with records, so knowing what to look for can speed up the process. 


• The purpose of each vaccine- owners will ask. Know which vaccines are considered core vaccines at your clinic (typically rabies and distemper) and which are more lifestyle dependent (like bordetella, lepto).

• All of the flea, tick, and heartworm medications. Different practices will carry different things, but having some knowledge of what is covered by Bravecto, Simparica Trio, Heartgard, and Nexgard is a good start.

**More practical things to make sure you’re familiar with:**

• Know how to write/interpret a check and count change efficiently

• Know how to address mail (sometimes practices will send welcome/sympathy cards to owners)

• Know the conversion between kilos and pounds (2.2 pounds/kilo)

• Know normal heart rate ranges for animals of different sizes",congrats new position things helped memorize new vet assistant animal vaccine administered age booster many years good choices owner make etc hardest appointments new vet assistant new clientspets records knowing look speed process purpose vaccine owners ask know vaccines considered core vaccines clinic typically rabies distemper lifestyle dependent like bordetella lepto flea tick heartworm medications different practices carry different things knowledge covered bravecto simparica trio heartgard nexgard good start practical things make sure youre familiar know writeinterpret check count change efficiently know address mail sometimes practices send welcomesympathy cards owners know conversion kilos pounds poundskilo know normal heart rate ranges animals different sizes,0,0,others

1347,Lonely_Technology,"I worked at a large practice during a transition to digital and it sucked. I don't think there's any secret trick to it, it's just a lot of labor. With that being said here are some things we did to streamline the process:

1. Remove as many charts from the pool of charts that need to be scanned. Go through and take every chart for a patient you haven't seen in 3 years (or whatever your local law may stipulate) and immediately separate them and archive or store them. Same for deceased patients. 

2. You need to figure out a format and system for how you want to organize the digital files. We opted to go with a system where about 15-20 pages was chosen as the max. For 90% of patients, that was the entire paper record. For patients with denser files, we separated the chucks into years, and further into months for some patients with extensive histories. Make sure to establish naming and filing conventions. 

3. Hire a temp if you can. At it's core, this is a basic data entry job. See if a local temp agency can set you up with a short term or part time person to help with this work. 

4. Determine how to handle abnormal attachments and other odd stuff. Across the thousands of files I scanned, so many had staples, paperclips, tape, whatever. Common items were smaller x-ray films, lab request forms (like the old antech carbon copy ones), photos from urolith labs, even little envelopes with digital rads and ultrasound files on CDs. 

5. Separate the tasks of scanning the files and linking them. Scanning should be done in bulk, then linking in bulk. If you constantly scan and then immediately try to attach the files you'll never make a dent in the work. 

6. Start with the newest charts first and hopefully by the time you get around to the older stuff it may have aged out of the timeframe you're required to keep records. 


Also this may go without saying, but I would recommend keeping the physical charts (even just in offsite storage) for some amount of time. We ended up with a number of files that got corrupted, were lost, or otherwise had errors and we needed to go back to the physical chart.",worked large practice transition digital sucked dont think theres secret trick lot labor said things streamline process remove many charts pool charts need scanned go take every chart patient havent seen years whatever local law may stipulate immediately separate archive store deceased patients need figure format system want organize digital files opted go system pages chosen max patients entire paper record patients denser files separated chucks years months patients extensive histories make sure establish naming filing conventions hire temp core basic data entry job see local temp agency set short term part time person help work determine handle abnormal attachments odd stuff across thousands files scanned many staples paperclips tape whatever common items smaller xray films lab request forms like old antech carbon copy ones photos urolith labs even little envelopes digital rads ultrasound files cds separate tasks scanning files linking scanning done bulk linking bulk constantly scan immediately try attach files youll never make dent work start newest charts first hopefully time get around older stuff may aged timeframe youre required keep records also may go without saying would recommend keeping physical charts even offsite storage amount time ended number files got corrupted lost otherwise errors needed go back physical chart,0,0,others

You should work as a vet assistant or tech for at least a year, ideally in more than one hospital to get a real sense of whether you will genuinely enjoy the field enough to put yourself through tremendous debt that will take a very long time to pay off. Vets have very long days, the emotional toll is large. Whether you are dealing with euthanasias, difficult clients, or difficult cases. There is a reason there is so much suicide in vet med. My colleague has been out of vet school for over 10 years and still have over $200,000 in debt. My friend that graduated 2 years ago has over $300,000 in debt. I am more fortunate because my parents helped pay for some of my schooling so I am currently debt free and I still occasionally question if I want to still be a vet at times. If it's your dream to be a vet and you have experienced working at a vet hospital and still have the same dream, go for it!

1. Yes, I think this a shared experience. Some techs often don’t give you the respect you deserve. It’s often discouraging, disheartening and can really make you feel bad about yourself. It’s hard, because you’ve worked hard and are probably struggling with your own negative self talk, let alone having to take onboard what the vet techs are saying as well. Brush it off and don’t let them get to you. Despite what the other commenter said, I disagree that you don’t deserve respect. You’ve worked hard.

BUT 

2. They’ve also worked hard. Don’t be arrogant about your position and make people call you “doctor”. It’s the wrong attitude to take towards things. You aren’t above them, nor are they above you. They should treat you with respect and an understanding that you know a lot of things that they don’t.

1378,ClearWaves,"Anatomy of great apes and humans is very similar. There  simply isn't a veterinarian with as much experience as this MD. Other specialty surgeries, like ortho or dentistry, are also performed by MDs or dentists.  The animals in question are too valuable to not have the best person available to perform the procedure. Would a human doctor be called to perform a c-section on a lion? No. The lion's anatomy is closer to a cat than a human, so a veterinarian is more suited for the job. 

As far as legality goes... every state has different laws, and different types of animals are governed by different laws. As in domestic pets, livestock, poultry, wildlife, laboraty animals, etc.

Research facilities follow different rules than a small animal general practice. As a zoo is likely accredited as a research institution. That means having to follow certain rules but also makes allowances for treatments that don't apply to a privately owned dog or cat.

In short: in this case, an MD is the best person for the job, and the laws of each state's veterinary medical board have set rules for different areas of verterinary medicine.",anatomy great apes humans similar simply isnt veterinarian much experience md specialty surgeries like ortho dentistry also performed mds dentists animals question valuable best person available perform procedure would human doctor called perform csection lion lions anatomy closer cat human veterinarian suited job far legality goes every state different laws different types animals governed different laws domestic pets livestock poultry wildlife laboraty animals etc research facilities follow different rules small animal general practice zoo likely accredited research institution means follow certain rules also makes allowances treatments dont apply privately owned dog cat short case md best person job laws states veterinary medical board set rules different areas verterinary medicine,veterinarian,doctor,veterinarian

Possibly, but inclined to think less likely since they’re NWB digits and it’s not all of them.

People on social media like to think what’s shared is the entirety of a convo. The vet who replied was out of line imo. I rarely chime into posts to reflect on the DVM - bc we all know things owners say can be a miscommunication from what was originally said.

Or if a wound on a distal limb is bandaged for care and owners can’t follow bandage care regimen. Amputations are then discussed. Is it less than ideal that an owner can’t be compliant? Yes.

1474,defiroose,">Running a residential node doesn't doesn't have much of a cost since you are already paying for the services you will be using

Maybe true, but the cost is not nothing because of human capital plus electricity. This cost is certainly more than $1 a month. Thus it's not break-even for some people.

That leaderboard is quite insightful. It illustrates the high centralization of the network. The majority of nodes are earning very little income. Only a few are earning income that'd make running a node worthwhile. The bigger trouble is, the nodes with the highest income are from countries with high cost of living. This further reduces the incentivization for node operators because those incomes are more appealing to people living in low cost of living countries, yet those incomes aren't possible to obtain for those who'd desire it.

Without some major improvements, it's hard to envision this being sustainable in the long term. It comes down to relying on volunteers. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xmjgka/tested_running_a_node_for_a_month/ippajma/",running residential node doesnt doesnt much cost since already paying services using maybe true cost nothing human capital plus electricity cost certainly month thus breakeven people leaderboard quite insightful illustrates high centralization network majority nodes earning little income earning income thatd make running node worthwhile bigger trouble nodes highest income countries high cost living reduces incentivization node operators incomes appealing people living low cost living countries yet incomes arent possible obtain whod desire without major improvements hard envision sustainable long term comes relying volunteers rmysteriumnetworkcommentsxmjgkatestedrunninganodeforamonthippajma,0,0,others

It was definitely one of the worst experiences of my life and after that I just did what I needed to do and got the hell out of that school because I vowed even if I didn’t pass that rotation I would rather drop out than redo the year there.

If I were you I would look elsewhere as the job itself is stressful enough and adding on disrespectful technicians will just add to it.  Changing a hospital environment is basically impossible unless there is a mass quitting. On a side note that is awesome about the KCS, working at an ophthalmologist currently and we see so many patients for conjunctivitis that have KCS and never even knew about it.",sounds like great job bad environment part leaving vet jobs attitudes technicians technician unfortunately lot places dont want address poor attitudes technicians hard find still respect towards new doctor still deserve respect would look elsewhere job stressful enough adding disrespectful technicians add changing hospital environment basically impossible unless mass quitting side note awesome kcs working ophthalmologist currently see many patients conjunctivitis kcs never even knew,0,doctor,doctor

1702,RedundantMarsupial,"Hi! Not a vet, but have worked in both commercial and teaching farms for vet schools, small animal GP, and research models, which all required euthanasia in some capacity.

As for facing it throughout your veterinary career: it depends what you want to go into. During vet school, you will do euthanasias, learn about them, etc. If you plan on going into small animal, sedation before pushing euthanasia solution is common for a “traditional death”. If you love food animal/population medicine, it is quite different from euthanasia in GP. Even on teaching farms we use euthanasia solution but I have never euthanized this way in a commercial unit. If this is what you want to do, it may be hard to cope with euths. 

Coming from someone who used to cry and faint when I had to collect tissue samples from mice, let alone euthanize them, you do get a bit desensitized, to be frank. I call it exposure therapy, but the more you see the better it will sit with you. Most vet schools (at least that I’ve known) also have therapists and outreach for students/staff, which may be beneficial to you.

Sorry for such a long post, but I resonated a lot with how you felt.

If you're getting the shares at a discount rate, the EBITA margin is healthy, and you feel comfortable in the stability of the business, then probably a good idea if you don't need the money right now.

An additional factor is I'd also try to estimate how much this will obligate you to engage in managing the business and then if you're not going to get additional compensation for that, do a mental cost benefit analysis of the time you'll invest in the managing compared to the dividend revenue and expected cap gains of the equity.

You can also check out vets for different species, like horses, exotics, birds, companion, veearts etc. This exploration of the actual daily job beforehand is important. A lot of students quit, because it is way different than expected. It's not just cuddling puppies. It's a lot of working with humans too, and sad and frustrating moments. It's also amazing if you enjoy biology, medicine, learning how the body works etc. It's also very afwisselend, not a 9-5 sit on a desk chair kind of job. There are a lot of job options, so you could explore further what you like when studying. Many vets switch at least once between jobs like food industry, research or between different species.

The job is rewarding but tough, the same goes for the studies. Go to the open days in Utrecht and Belgium. Remember getting in is hard as well, have a plan b. I think there is still an option to switch to the master veterinarian medicine if you finish the bachelor animal sciences in Wageningen and choose a specific course. 
You could go for Ghent or Antwerp too, but those courses are quite tough on Dutch students, because of the cultural differences and differences in school systems. If you're good at studying loads of info in ridiculous detail, Belgium could suit you though. Unfortunately, they have an entrance exam now, which is very hard to pass. So prepare to study hard for that test if you go that road.

It's definitely not a requirement, but if you manage to find some side job related to animals or even at a veterinarian practice, you can get used to different animal species and also see what interests you.

1760,FrostyMeowmeow,"I had a similar feeling when I first started working as a veterinary assistant in 2015 after I graduated college, and it took a year of ""soul searching"" to figure out what I wanted to do with my career, as my degree was in general biology with a pre-med track. I decided medical school wasn't my calling and enjoyed the concept of medicine, but also the concept of zoology.


I shadowed for a few weeks with a general practitioner before applying for several clinics. I finally got a job, and the whiplash alongside the learning curve was highly discouraging. I vividly remember thinking at the end of my second week, ""What the hell did I get myself into?""


The learning curve is STEEP, but you'll learn to celebrate small victories. It's okay to feel as if your client interactions don't go smoothly or if you could've done something better handling an animal or assisting with a procedure.

My first goal in veterinary school was to obtain enough information to be a small animal general practitioner. During my last year of clinics, I realized the world of medicine is MUCH MUCH MUCH more profound than it appears. I'm finishing my last year of specialty training (almost four years post-doc). The further you get along in your training, the more science you incorporate into clinical practice.

I decided to do a small animal internal medicine residency because it's not GP. GP practitioners have demanding jobs in that they see high volume, are expected to be jacks of all trades, and must be highly pragmatic in diagnostic choices as frontline doctors. 

I'm fortunate to pick up where they left off after several weeks to months of diagnostics and management strategies. They do the filtering to recommend motivated owners to see a specialist. Internal medicine is still very client-heavy interaction. However, remember that other specialties do not necessarily require front-facing interactions with the public; you are still expected to have communication skills to interact with your colleagues and paraprofessional team, and depending on where you do your training -- students. Specialty is dependent on your interactions in the clinic with specialists in your area of interest, but also part of the pre-clinical curriculum with activities and clubs that serve as networking opportunities. These aren't things to worry about just yet -- you'll have plenty of time to investigate should you continue schooling.

Take it one day at a time. It will be hard, but there will also be great days along the road that make you look back with a big smile on your face, knowing that you've made a difference in somebody and their best friends' lives.",similar feeling first started working veterinary assistant graduated college took year soul searching figure wanted career degree general biology premed track decided medical school wasnt calling enjoyed concept medicine also concept zoology shadowed weeks general practitioner applying several clinics finally got job whiplash alongside learning curve highly discouraging vividly remember thinking end second week hell get learning curve steep youll learn celebrate small victories okay feel client interactions dont go smoothly couldve done something better handling animal assisting procedure first goal veterinary school obtain enough information small animal general practitioner last year clinics realized world medicine much much much profound appears im finishing last year specialty training almost four years postdoc get along training science incorporate clinical practice decided small animal internal medicine residency gp gp practitioners demanding jobs see high volume expected jacks trades must highly pragmatic diagnostic choices frontline doctors im fortunate pick left several weeks months diagnostics management strategies filtering recommend motivated owners see specialist internal medicine still clientheavy interaction however remember specialties necessarily require frontfacing interactions public still expected communication skills interact colleagues paraprofessional team depending training students specialty dependent interactions clinic specialists area interest also part preclinical curriculum activities clubs serve networking opportunities arent things worry yet youll plenty time investigate continue schooling take one day time hard also great days along road make look back big smile face knowing youve made difference somebody best friends lives,veterinarian,doctor,veterinarian

For your school of interest - make sure they have a high case load, strong emergency department (you will spend a lot of time here) and enough faculty in your field of interest to mentor you and write letters.

1811,SupaGinga8,"Depending on where you are, the amount of “hands on” tech work you’re allowed to do can vary. If you’re in a state with title protection, then you’ll either have to start as an assistant or consider going to tech school. If there isn’t title protection in your state, then I say find a place that’s willing to train you on the job as a tech. People get really uptight about title protection and uncertified techs performing that role. While I agree that you shouldn’t be doing things you’re not trained in or are uncomfortable performing, I do think that with the right training and environment you can get your feet wet and see what the field is like. Free continuing education is your friend! Find an area that interests you and seek out lectures, conferences, journals, even textbooks in that subject. I went close to 6 years as a vet assistant before moving to a state that allowed for licensure through my accrued hours of work and just recently got my RVT license. 

As far as the field in general, there will be long days. There will be emotionally charged situations with clients. Statistically, every single one of your patients will die before you do (assuming you don’t work with some crazy long lifespan species). But there is so much to learn and immerse yourself in and so much good to be done.

1860,Sad-Rhubarb1988,"I am sorry you’re going through this, it does sound like a very toxic workplace. 

I agree with what many above have said, but one question I had is are you constantly voicing these comparisons you’re making about yourself/your outcomes and the other vets in the workplace? This can contribute to why people are treating you rudely. No one likes it when their colleagues are being thrown under the bus. Hindsight is always 20/20, and something you may have now “caught” is not necessarily something your colleague has “missed.” If you are seeing these cases and sharing with everyone how you caught something they missed etc etc, that behavior can be off putting to them. If you’re constantly telling people you have no complications but so and so sutured omentum outside of the abdomen, then again this won’t be received well. Complications will happen to everyone, it doesn’t matter how perfectly you did everything. Something may be obvious to you at a second recheck but during the initial evaluation it was not as obvious to whoever saw it first. Please remember that, because it is never the intention of any of our colleagues to miss something, misdiagnose something, or contribute to surgical complications. 

You should bring up the rude comments your staff has made with whoever their supervisor is. If you have concerns about the other veterinarians in the practice, then it is something you can discuss with the medical director. 

I am not saying how they are treating you is ok (because it’s not). When a practice hires a new grad, there is an expectation of some sort of learning curve, need for mentorship, being slower than more proficient and experienced doctors, etc. All the staff should be used to this, and should be on board.",sorry youre going sound like toxic workplace agree many said one question constantly voicing comparisons youre making yourselfyour outcomes vets workplace contribute people treating rudely one likes colleagues thrown bus hindsight always something may caught necessarily something colleague missed seeing cases sharing everyone caught something missed etc etc behavior putting youre constantly telling people complications sutured omentum outside abdomen wont received well complications happen everyone doesnt matter perfectly everything something may obvious second recheck initial evaluation obvious whoever saw first please remember never intention colleagues miss something misdiagnose something contribute surgical complications bring rude comments staff made whoever supervisor concerns veterinarians practice something discuss medical director saying treating ok practice hires new grad expectation sort learning curve need mentorship slower proficient experienced doctors etc staff used board,veterinarian,doctor,veterinarian

But these are balanced out by blocks with more leisurely schedules like Ancillary or Shelter Med. 

There are three big tips I have that can dictate how your 4th year will go:
1.) Be as efficient and proactive as you can during the day. If you can do this you can usually still leave each day at a decent time even on harder blocks.
2.) Be a helpful block mate and don’t dodge hard cases. Your classmates will notice this and will help you in return.
3.) Approach every situation with a positive growth mindset. You have worked so hard to earn the privilege to work with real patients and you will truly be amazed by how much you will learn and grow in one short year.

1917,Warrioryote,"First of all, congratulations in advance! It’s an exciting time getting to go out and take the first job! Don’t feel bad about being nervous or unprepared. It’s a lot to keep track of and it’s your first time doing it. Some practices may try to take advantage of that, but everyone has had their ‘first time’ doing this, and there are plenty of practices out there that will appreciate that and be supportive, even given the employee/employer dynamic. Many doctors and practices enjoy the opportunity to mentor and share the profession with new grads. 

I’ll try to limit my response to something additive to what’s already been posted, those are good replies with additional great advice. IMO first thing is to look at yourself as the asset you are. Practices don’t run without doctors and they’re hiring because they need you. You’re an essential piece of the business, even if you don’t feel like it yet. Even though you don’t have the most clinical experience out of everyone in the room, you -are- bringing with you the most up to date knowledge as a new grad, and experienced doctors know they can learn from you too, not just the other way around. It’s not something to flaunt, but being aware of that may help with confidence during the process. 

Veterinary medicine is a rewarding, but challenging and emotionally demanding work environment. Work culture is a -huge- part of everyone’s job satisfaction, so making sure you feel like it’s a team you want to work with before you bite is an essential part of the interview process. 

Little things like electronic vs written records, scheduling, whether or not you can request stocking meds you prefer to work with,  and big things like a commitment to mentorship and training can be everything for whether you love or hate the job. Think of the interview less as you being in the hot seat, and more as a way to get to know the hospital you’re looking at. You can say no too if you get bad vibes and feel like it’s not the right fit for you.

I’d recommend writing out a list of things that are important to you in your job. Some things are obvious, like how many days a week are you going to be asked to work, or will you work weekends or on call. Some are less so, such as ‘do you have a quiet place to call clients’. They’re interviewing you, but you’re also interviewing them to see if it’s a right fit for you.  List questions and bring them with you to the interview. Everyone loses if you and your hospital don’t mesh so it’s in everyone’s best interest for you to try and find somewhere else if you don’t feel confident it’s where you want to be. 

Which brings me to this - ASK those questions about all of these things. Show interest in the staff and talk to them if it’s a working interview/if you’re touring the practice and there’s an opportunity. If you see things that interest you, ask about them. If you encounter something that seems like a deficit, eg: a practice that doesn’t have point of care ultrasound and that’s important to you, there’s an opportunity to say it’s something you’d like to do in practice and see if it’s an option to work towards that in the future. 

It’s important to think about salary and benefits and what’s important to you. Depending on the hospital you deal with, some might spring offers or questions about what you’re looking for during an initial interview. Most will not bring this up until they’ve discussed the interview and are presenting an offer after the fact though - ie: salary and benefit negotiation is something that usually happens after the interview and they’re wanting to move forward with a hire. If you do get that sprung on you when you’re not ready, don’t give specific numbers. You need time to review and consider things like final salary, ancillary benefits etc. and you can tell them to make you an offer - ultimately those details should be offered on paper, not by word of mouth. Do have an idea of the BALANCE of salary, benefits, PTO, weekends/on-call, signing bonus etc. that are important to you to engage on those questions if they happen, though. 

The AVMA has a new grad expected salary calculator by state and specialty on its website - it’s a guideline, not a given, and things like better hours or benefits may correlate with a salary that is lower than this guideline (and that may be worth it for a job you love to go to every day) - but this can at least give you a ballpark of what you can expect so you don’t accidentally undervalue yourself. 

If you have resources at your school for placement, reach out to them. Some schools will provide local business information where you are looking, some will even help arrange mock interviews to get the jitters out before you go to the real deal. These take extra time and effort to utilize, but they can make a huge difference in helping you land the perfect job. 

Lastly, when you do get that job offer - and you will, don’t decide immediately. Don’t waste a practice’s time, either. My school gave a guideline of a 72 hour yes or no window, but taking the time to have a contract reviewed, soul search your priorities, and negotiate changes is reasonable, and in many cases expected. If there’s something you don’t see on a contract that is important to you, and reasonable to request, make sure you ask for it. You may not get it, but if you don’t ask you definitely will not. Eg: if downtime or vacation is really important to you, and you think you’ve found the perfect job, but they’re only offering 2 weeks vacation.  Don’t ask for 5, you’re probably not getting it and it’ll sound wild. But saying ‘vacation time is important to my work life balance, is there room to increase that some?’ Is reasonable and may be something they’re willing to agree to in order to seal the deal. Keep in mind that this specific request (more PTO) can affect your ability to hit production if you’re on a pro-sal or similar pay system. Substitute your priorities for pto here as you will. 

Most of all, try to enjoy the process. You’re embarking on an awesome new chapter of your life and interviewing is an opportunity to explore what’s out there.

1924,JustNaNaNa,"What do YOU want in a practice? Most new grads don’t stay with their first practice for more than a year because they followed the money or some other reason.

Some things I made clear I wanted as a new grad was mentorship above all else. If that’s important to you, make sure you bring it up. If they say they don’t offer it, thank them for their time and move on.

Is work culture important to you? Some vet clinics historically have toxic work culture. Is the turnover rate for support staff high? Are they always hiring? Those are red flags for me. Search up the companies you are being hired with on indeed or glass door to see if there have been good experiences for employees. If you have the option, ask to follow them around for the day. Listen to how the support staff talk when the vets aren’t around. Do you want a family close knit team or what have you. 

Work life balance important? Many new grads are focusing more on work life balance and a lot of companies are trying to get more vets by offering 4 day work weeks or 3 day work weeks. 

Do you hate surgery? Find a practice that allows you to never do surgery. My friend hates surgery and has found a GP that allows them to just see GP/urgents. 


Whatever region you’re working in, a quick google search can help find a rough “average” salary of a vet. Do some searches on Reddit to see if anyone posted about the salary they make. 
Big city? More than likely over 6 figure salary. Some rural area? Maybe mid to high 5 figure. (Assuming US) — also depends if you’re small animal only, mixed, or large.

If you have to move, calculate what would be an adequate moving bonus (how much would it cost you to uproot your stuff and move) 

Signing bonuses for new grades range from 0-50k I’ve seen from my colleagues.

1939,Budgie_Smuggler24,"I'm on the PSLF route and I work in the non-profit vet world (think shelter medicine, high quality high volume spay/neuter). I cannot imagine doing anything else. All I've ever wanted to be is a vet. It's been a bumpy ride. I'm 8 years out and have finally figured out how to make this work for me mentally, physically, etc. 

  
1. You have to be thinking about loans and actively make a plan as to how you're gonna pay them back. This also requires a lot of self-study about finances, loans, paperwork etc  (I realized PSLF and doing non-profit work was a win-win for me but I sustained a lot of workplace trauma trying to find the right fit. There's annual paperwork involved.  I'm committed to 10 years of nonprofit/government work).  
2. You have to stand up for yourself, including leaving jobs you hate even when its hard to walk away; you need to know when you're being abused by your employer. You have to actively get yourself out of shitty situations that usually involve difficult people and sometimes money. It's awkward, there's lots of feelings, it sucks.   
3. Create a life outside of vet med. This sounds easy before you go to vet school, but studying and then post-grad learning/working consumes your life. You become used to working so hard, its naturally easy to just become a workaholic as there's always room for improvement. You have to find a healthy balance and maintain relationships or you will be unhappy.   


My days are now 32-40 hours a week. No on call. I can leave work at work most of the time. Lots of surgery and puppies/kittens, which I enjoy. I don't need to do it all anymore because I have and its burnt me out multiple times. I have found what I'm good at and don't bite off more than I can chew. If I could do it all over again I would have advocated for myself more. I would have trusted my intuition and quit jobs I knew weren't working for me, even if that meant breaking a contract or potentially living off savings for a bit.

1947,PrettyButEmpty,"If you are in the US, ACVS requires a rotating internship or equivalent (I think 5 years?) clinical experience in private practice. Realistically, this means that almost everyone who wants a surgical residency does an internship. Twofold: meeting the requirement, and possibly even more importantly making contacts with surgeons. Applying for residency requires you to submit letters of rec from ACVS diplomats. If you are out in practice for 5 years, and the only surgeons you know are your professors from school, it will be challenging to get the number and quality of letters that you need to successfully match. 

Given the competitive nature of surgical residencies, it is also common for applicants to complete 1 or more surgical internships, so I would also keep that in mind during your calculations.  

If you work in a position that allows you to maintain regular contact and good relationships with surgeons, an alternative path could be an option. But it’s an uphill battle, unfortunately. I have also heard it expressed by multiple surgeons that they prefer new doctors as residents as they are “less likely to have bad habits”, so I would also be leery of that bias harming you. 

In general, if you REALLY want to be a surgeon and you can financially swing it, going the internship route will probably give you the best shot. If you would be happy as an ER doctor you can still do a lot of surgery, and you can step out of vet school into a job paying easily 200k. I’m a surgeon; I love it and don’t regret my choices at all, but you need to really want it, and it definitely comes with some opportunity cost.",us acvs requires rotating internship equivalent think years clinical experience private practice realistically means almost everyone wants surgical residency internship twofold meeting requirement possibly even importantly making contacts surgeons applying residency requires submit letters rec acvs diplomats practice years surgeons know professors school challenging get number quality letters need successfully match given competitive nature surgical residencies also common applicants complete surgical internships would also keep mind calculations work position allows maintain regular contact good relationships surgeons alternative path could option uphill battle unfortunately also heard expressed multiple surgeons prefer new doctors residents less likely bad habits would also leery bias harming general really want surgeon financially swing going internship route probably give best shot would happy er doctor still lot surgery step vet school job paying easily k im surgeon love dont regret choices need really want definitely comes opportunity cost,0,doctor,doctor

During my rotating internship, I did an externship at the clinic where I wanted to do my residency and made a good impression there as well, and they took me on as a resident outside the match.

2093,Lopsided-Switch-8404,"My partner is currently an intern at a well known and well regarded small animal rotating internship. I'm in a different profession that is also known for having long hours and a very demanding culture, especially when you first join the profession or work at the ""elite"" level. 

Working long hours because you are in a complex, busy, and demanding profession is fairly understandable to me. What is blowing my mind about the veterinary internship and resident process is the level of abuse interns receive from residents and senior clinicians. Some of the things people say to interns would get people fired immediately in my profession, and my profession is known for having a fairly cutthroat environment. So many senior veterinarians operate with the mentality of ""it was hard for me, and so it should be hard for you."" The point of the internship seems to be suffering and discount labor, not training, patient care, or gaining experience.

This internship has formal rules that are designed to support interns (e.g., an intern can't have more than X number of inpatients at one time; hours limitations related to overnight shifts; etc.) that are openly and flagrantly violated on a daily basis. For example, after working for 15 hours and having well over the maximum number of permitted inpatients my partner asked if someone else could take one of my partner's inpatients. My partner was berated by a resident for being lazy and not caring about their patients. This happened publicly in front of other residents and clinicians and no one said or did anything. This is a common occurrence.

Senior clinicians have said blatantly racist things that the interns are afraid to report due to a culture of retaliation.

There's an in-house social worker who has repeatedly expressed concerns about intern well being and a culture of abuse and exploitation, and those concerns have been brushed off by leadership repeatedly.

There needs to be more oversight of these programs and actual consequences for programs not adhering to their own rules.",partner currently intern well known well regarded small animal rotating internship im different profession also known long hours demanding culture especially first join profession work elite level working long hours complex busy demanding profession fairly understandable blowing mind veterinary internship resident process level abuse interns receive residents senior clinicians things people say interns would get people fired immediately profession profession known fairly cutthroat environment many senior veterinarians operate mentality hard hard point internship seems suffering discount labor training patient care gaining experience internship formal rules designed support interns eg intern cant x number inpatients one time hours limitations related overnight shifts etc openly flagrantly violated daily basis example working hours well maximum number permitted inpatients partner asked someone else could take one partners inpatients partner berated resident lazy caring patients happened publicly front residents clinicians one said anything common occurrence senior clinicians said blatantly racist things interns afraid report due culture retaliation theres inhouse social worker repeatedly expressed concerns intern well culture abuse exploitation concerns brushed leadership repeatedly needs oversight programs actual consequences programs adhering rules,veterinarian,0,veterinarian

So if you’re a full time zoo vet, you will be seeing exotics.  But becoming a zoo vet is extremely competitive and difficult, and will require a lot of personal sacrifice.

There are also vets in private practice who see exotics.  Some even build up a client base so that they can almost exclusively see exotics.

2136,Is-thisthing-on,"Current UCD 4th year here! I had the pleasure of tracking livestock and being able to work closely with Dr. Chigerwe as a student technician in C barn as well as over my third and fourth year and feel the need to speak up for a very well respected colleague and mentor. Dr C has worked as a mentor to students throughout their 4years of vet school, beginning with orientation and taking on a mentor group each year as well as until recently working in a position where he worked specifically within the curriculum to ensure that students had adequate work life balance and places to report learning climate incidents to ensure that students felt heard and safe as they learned. Working with students on clinics, Dr. C has advocated the most for students and residents to have time off of any clinician I have worked with. In fact, he called me personally the day after I stayed at the hospital until 4am working on an emergency to tell me to take an extra few hours off past the 6 we are typically allowed to ensure that I was well rested. As far as the long work hours, I don’t think it’s fair to say that this is something that he specifically is responsible for. UCD has one of, if not the, largest caseloads of any vet school in the country, particularly for livestock (which is something I would expect you to know as an alumni). The unfortunate reality of the Livestock Medicine and Surgery service is that they are three services in one. They must manage scheduled appointments, in-patients, surgeries, and emergencies with one team. This means that one weeks when it is extremely busy or when there are outside circumstances (such as a major wildfire), the service is incredibly busy and there is simply no one else to take cases or help manage inpatients. The school does their best to help with this by shuffling technicians to other services when they are swamped or having underclassmen or off duty clinicians volunteer their time when necessary to relieve the burden, but this is not a perfect solution. I absolutely agree with the post author that the overworking of residents and interns is a serious problem within this field, and remain hopeful that solutions can be proposed in the next few years. I do think it is unprofessional to single out a specific clinician as a villain in what is most best described as a systemic problem.

2137,HumanProject7893,"Hey! I did a graduate programme with V4P and I have to say the training is very good, definitely worth it. However, the downside of this programme (and most of new grad programmes I know from corporates) is that the actual CPDs/training are quite scarce in the sense that you'll do one every couple of months (roughly). The training has a good quality but they give it to you in small sporadic doses so that you have to stick with them during those 2 years, not that it takes 2 years to do that training at all lol. You'd be able to do it in 1-2 months if anything.

So it was overall a good quality programme and a nice extra if you're just planning to do GP for a while with no rush, but if you were thinking of maybe doing a certificate or an internship (these programmes are NOT an internship) etc I'd tell you to do the certificate at the same time with the new grad programme (totally doable time-wise) or do an internship directly.

If you specialize, you won't be wealthy but you can make a little more than the average cost of living in a lot of areas. Doctors make more of course, but they can easily find themselves in a lifetime of debt. The schooling is a pretty massive undertaking as well.

Think about what you are actually interested in, and look at alternative careers related to that. Do you like medicine, biology, science in general?

2260,Environmental-Key512,"145-160k plus super, depending on bonus for myself. 
No weekends, small animals. 
8-11 years out (got to try to stay anonymous out here!)

New grads on about 70-85k plus super

Recent grads after leaving their first job 90-100k plus super

3+ years vets 100k+, plus super

Care with places that advertise as salary package (includes super). In my experience they seem to be less likely to pay well and have an unhealthy perspective on what a decent offer is for an employee. 

Locums 80-100/h depending on competency/experience. That's usually using an ABN so paying their own super and leave. Most seem to be around 90. Some corporates pay on casual contracts $80-90 plus super. The pay depends on experience/memberships. 

I suggest accepting the fact you will need to move jobs a few times, progressively achieving pay rises each time. This is when you have the most leverage. 

Get memberships, they absolutely translate to better pay, particularly in high quality clinics. The clinics that don't value memberships, generally don't represent the cream of the industry anyway. Surgery is a great membership, imaging is another, GP memberships are decent (talking smallies here). Medicine is good as well but doesn't have the same revenue generation opportunity. That being said, you should study what your find i testing, otherwise you will be miserable during the preparation. 

The willingness to do surgery is a massive bonus, it's amazing how many new/recent grads either can't do it/are terrified to perform it. I'm talking speys/castrates/lumpectomy/dental. Nothing crazy really. 

If you are aren't tied down by financial responsibility (kids). You can work here for a year or so to find your feet, then travel around Aus locuming. You can often get accomodations for coastal rural placements, good pay and see some beautiful country. .

- Kookaburra Vets
- Vetlink

Vetlink is better suited to finding you a clinic that may suit your needs/what your looking for. There is more of a 'match the right clinic for the right person view. That being said, vetlink charges a massive fee to the employer, which may reduce the pay they offer. So that's to say, Kookaburra Vets may be more hit and miss and up to you to find a good fit but the pay opportunities will likely be higher. 

Some jobs describe their pay rates online, that may give you a guide. Note, the top pay is for people with 10 years experience and/or leadership experience/positions and/or memberships.

2315,marchbanks273,"Hey OP,

I have also gone through what you're going through. I had minimal vet experience before and through my degree, and COVID ruined my final year placements as a 2020 grad (they became online school instead). I came out as a veterinarian that had little knowledge and skill and as a result I suffered so much anxiety and imposter syndrome. It got to the point where I became scared of doing any consult where the patient was mildly sick and I almost left the industry.

I'm now three years out and at a teaching hospital teaching final year students, and it's cool to see how far I've come. What helped me was a supportive environment while I found my confidence. Vomiting cases more complicated than a maropitant injection used to terrify me, especially if they came back the next day. Now I actively enjoy the puzzle of figuring out the next steps instead of reacting with fear. I have coworkers that love to contribute their thoughts and are there to support me when things still don't go right. Even if you make a mistake, then the least you can do is make it a learning experience for yourself so that the next patient you encounter will benefit from what you've learned. I still get anxious time to time, and I think my first year as a new grad was not great for my imposter syndrome but time and experience has helped me so much with my nerves. You should never too be hard on yourself as a new grad - I'm sure the past you in early DVM would be very proud of the things you've achieved as a veterinarian, and when you're a seasoned vet you'll also look back on how far you've come.

2343,LetsGoooat,"The formula is M = DWV/kR. The value of k depends on the units used for every other variable.  We're using these:

M = total amount of drug in mg  
D = CRI rate in mcg/kg/min  
W = body weight in kg  
V = total volume in the CRI syringe in mL  
R = rate of delivery in mL/hr

Plugging these units in:

mg = (mcg\*kg\*mL\*hr)/(k\*kg\*min\*mL)

simplify:

mg = (mcg\*hr)/(k\*min)

solve for k:

k = (mcg\*hr)/(mg\*min) = (mcg/mg)\*(hr/min) = 1000\*(1/60) = 16.67

It's very important to recognize the 16.67 only works if you are using exactly these units.

2357,RosasharnSun,"So I’m a recently SA qualified vet. We had 2 people in our year from North America, both had biological science degrees with honours postgrads but both had to start in 1st year (and I’m sure you’re aware it’s a 6 year course with the first year basically being just non vet sciences). Once you complete your BVSc, to practice in SA you need to complete a compulsory community service year and you only can do it in the year after you graduated. No comserve = no council registration.
You can use the degree to practice in the UK, AUS and NZ without comserve.

OP is definitely a planet of its own. It’s in a very isolated part of town and some people struggle with that, especially in residence. There is a campus psychologist who comes 1 a week but her waiting list was always stacked and it would take months to see her. Pretoria north is functionally 30 minutes from Pretoria main. 

Residence the party/drinking culture is wild but there is space for studying. Academics wise they have changed a lot of things now even since my time - I was part of the last group to endure the block system and to have to have the equines module crammed into 1 semester. It’s definitely tough and a distinction is 75% (in the old days it used to be 65% but honestly the way they test it might as well be!). Admin tends to be on the disorganised side and you often get told of important things the day before (sometimes even the morning of!). And the exam paper setting - my mother is a medical professor and when I told her about some of them she would just gawp in astonishment. It’s not very standardised but hey suppose it makes you think in the fifth dimension

Species wise - expect a lot of ruminant theory  work. Majority of the theory is focused on ruminants throughout the modules. We do have dedicated smallies and equines modules. Wildlife is a very small one semester module in 5th year and exotics is an elective week during clinics. Majority of clinics was smallies rotations as that keeps the hospital ticking over financially.
Clinics are a very vigorous 18 months. The 1 week of ICU night shift rotation is infamous. Like anywhere there are good clinicians and bad clinicians. They do get away quite easily if they aren’t the nicest person to students. But for the most part they do their jobs really well and are good clinicians. 

But yeah doing the NAVLE if you want to go back to America to practice should be definitely on your mind. It’s an expensive test and I think for the SA guys (I was looking into it at a point but decided naaah) was about $10 000. Maybe it will be less if you have American degrees but the majority of the cost was the veterinary testing the and practical exams. 
Hope this helps - you definitely need to make this an informed decision and weigh up the reasons for going to SA. I wouldn’t say the standard of veterinary education would be higher than in the states. Definitely has its own flavour!

2393,watermelon-milkshake,"I’m going to have to agree with those saying OP is making generalizations based on one person’s bad experience in vet school and not based on a real general consensus.

Generally speaking, my instructors and classmates in vet school could not have been less toxic. Certainly there were instructors who had bad attitudes and/or sometimes set unreasonable standards for students to meet, but those were few and far between and you learn how to navigate their presence. For the most part everyone recognizes how challenging this profession is and help with concepts and support from classmates abound.

Perfectionism is rampant among veterinary professionals but most people get pretty good at managing these tendencies once they’ve been out of vet school for a year or two. Once you’ve been in the “real world” practicing as a licensed doctor you will quickly learn that it is impossible to be perfect and you are only hurting your own mental health in trying to be so.

Speaking as a wildlife veterinarian, there is absolutely no way that any veterinary school could provide classes that go deep into topics on every taxonomic group (and still manage to cover all the important anatomy/physiology/pharmacology/medicine topics required for medicine in any species) and I’m glad they don’t try. Dog, cat, cow, and horse medicine is the bread and butter of veterinary schools because most people who are there will be primarily working on these species, and those who won’t will base much of the medicine they practice on the concepts learned about these species. I would never be able to work on a tiger if I weren’t comfortable with house cat medicine. The same goes for avian/fish/herps/etc. - most of what we do with these groups is based on what we know about domestic species. There are many schools which do provide excellent training opportunities (didactic courses, rotations, research experience) for those with special interest in wildlife/zoo/zca/aquatics, and even if your school does not provide much of this you still have the opportunity to gain experience while in school through externships and/or summer jobs and attending conventions. This is also a great way to network as training programs and jobs in wildlife/zoo/zca/aquatics/aquaculture are among the most highly competitive and making connections is a good way to break down some of these barriers. The “real” training to prepare you for being comfortable with working on nondomestic species is through internship and residency. And even the 4+ years of specialized post-doc training requires much discipline and drive to study outside of your clinical responsibility (on your days off) in order to be prepared to sit boards to specialize. In short - this lack of experience is on you. Sorry.

Yes, there are many ignorant people who do not see veterinarians as “real doctors”. This should have come as no surprise. There are plenty of jobs where you do not face this sort of speculation regularly, and it’s your choice to let this bother you anyway. If I concerned myself with the opinions of all the ignorant people who speculate about my occupation I would go absolutely mad. The people who matter will see you as a “real doctor”, I promise. 

I work many long days (and nights and weekends). The reality of the schedules worked by many veterinarians also should not have come as a surprise to you. If you are considering working in a field like aquatics or aquaculture, much like in the rest of the zoo/wildlife/exotics world you will absolutely be expected to take some on-call shifts and work weekends throughout your specialty training and career. Depending on your job you may be working with high-profile animals (or those considered food animals) in which case many ailments are considered emergencies, meaning you have some long days ahead of you. However, even in jobs where nights or weekends are worked, a healthy work/life balance is absolutely achievable. It just takes practice and good time management skills. Having to write records at home varies from job to job but I would argue that this is less often the case and largely depends on the individual. I’m actually not allowed to write records at home in my current position. Some of my friends who practice elsewhere write records at home and many do not.

2394,Busy-Boysenberry-435,"I think they could be lowballing you. You need to ask the clinic what they project your production for that clinic will be when you are out of the “internship” style start. Just because it is an “internship style” where you are being mentored and adjusting to being a new doctor, doesn’t mean they should pay you less than what they project you to produce (production divided by 5 is estimated salary). If you feel uncomfortable with 80k, you need to justify as to why you deserve more. What are your strengths you bring to the clinic? What is the cost of living in your area? What are other competitive salaries like for vets in the area? What is the AVMA average for your state?

 If they are firm with 80k, you need to have it in your contract that you are allowed to renegotiate your salary after the first year so you can be paid equitably.

2409,HyenaLucky3644,"If you’re open to moving internationally for school, that could also be a potential avenue for you. I was in a similar position (got a BA, didn’t have the pre-reqs for US Vet schools, was miserable in my field), so I did some research on programs that didn’t have those prerequisite course requirements. After weighing my options, I decided to go out on a limb and apply for some international programs at the age of 24, and now I’m in the pre-selection semester at Massey University in New Zealand! 

There are definitely ups and downs to this path. My program is designed for kids coming straight out of HS, with no university experience. This means that a.) a significant portion of my cohort is a lot younger than me (im 25 now!!) and b.) the degree is structured in such a way that if you don’t perform well in the first semester (the pre-selection phase), you won’t advance in the program. This can add a lot of stress to the first semester, especially if you’re uprooting your whole adult life to move countries ( l o l ). The program is also 5 years long, instead of the standard 4 years. 

That being said, I’m really happy I came here. I’ve met several students who are also older (people up in their late 30’s !!) and it seems like we all kind of flock together. The courses are rigorous, but if you’ve done any uni before and understand time management, etc. they’re very doable. The cost of attendance after converting from USD to NZD is lower per year than out of state tuition to US vet schools, but paying for the 5th year of the program means that you’ll probably graduate with about the same amount of debt as an out-of-state US program. 

Right now I feel confident that I’ll be moving forward in the program, but if for whatever reason I’m not selected I would probably be singing a different tune. 

Do lots of research, and don’t be afraid to reach out to uni advisors with whatever questions you
may have about their programs. I also definitely second the advice of getting some hands on vet med experience before you decide anything final. Whatever you decide, good luck !!",youre open moving internationally school could also potential avenue similar position got ba didnt prereqs us vet schools miserable field research programs didnt prerequisite course requirements weighing options decided go limb apply international programs age im preselection semester massey university new zealand definitely ups downs path program designed kids coming straight hs university experience means significant portion cohort lot younger im b degree structured way dont perform well first semester preselection phase wont advance program add lot stress first semester especially youre uprooting whole adult life move countries l l program also years long instead standard years said im really happy came ive met several students also older people late seems like kind flock together courses rigorous youve done uni understand time management etc theyre doable cost attendance converting usd nzd lower per year state tuition us vet schools paying th year program means youll probably graduate amount debt outofstate us program right feel confident ill moving forward program whatever reason im selected would probably singing different tune lots research dont afraid reach uni advisors whatever questions may programs also definitely second advice getting hands vet med experience decide anything final whatever decide good luck,0,0,others

It helps if you separate out the actual medical record from other documents such as consent forms so that when you want to look at history, you get nothing but the chart notes. You certainly can and should save all those other documents, but just do it in a separate file.

What's slow is making sure that if you rely on your Cornerstone database to give alerts such as diagnostic codes or allergies or adverse reactions or handling recommendations or existing authorized prescription refills...each record has to be looked at and those things manually entered.

Our DVMs loathe looking at scanned records. Even \~ eight years down line we still have some paper charts because of this. If the patient's chart is more than an inch thick...hard nope on scanning. If the patient is of a certain age...hard nope on scanning. If the patient hasn't been seen in two years...hard nope on scanning.

Your time is more valuable spent generating income for the practice than scanning records. See patients.

Perks: 2+2 meaning 2 years didactics then 2 years clinics. The extra clinical experience was extremely helpful for navle prep. However this does mean more condensed course load at the start and you have shorter summers. 

Not many clinicians that I don’t love. The vast majority are fantastic teachers and very kind. Of course there’s always a few exceptions. 

Lots of elective time and off blocks in clinics that makes it easy to plan externships at other hospitals and feel out places you might want to work at. I definitely think this is more than most schools. From those I’ve talked to some only get one to two weeks off campus but we have roughly 17 weeks of time off (do what you want externships or just chill, go on vacation) and 10 weeks of elective time all of which can be arranged to be off campus if you want. 

Oh and in state tuition after 1 year if you’re out of state was a big plus. It’s pretty much guaranteed as long as you meet specific requirements like earning $2,000 in the first year and staying in Missouri during your first summer (you’re allowed 14 days out of state during the summer months)

2511,Nocranberry,"Setting boundaries. We talk about work-life balance all the time, but it really can be make or break in health industries. It's really important to be able to leave work at work. So turning off work chats, avoiding animal related social media, and knowing when to say, ""hey that non-urgent consult needs to be moved because I'm still dealing with cases x, y and z"". Bonus points if you can afford to live on a 4 day work week. That way, you're more okay to deal with long shifts as you've got that extra day to catch up on rest and to do nothing.

Use your leave. You don't have to go anywhere or do anything with it, but use it. I personally use mine to make sure I have the day off for friends and families birthdays as that's what's important to me, and there's been too many times when I've had to miss something because we've had an emergency come in 5 minutes to close. I enjoy my work, but the people in my home life still come first. Sometimes, I take a few days off just to spend time at home with my own animals as a mental refresher.

Counselling: even if you're feeling mentally okay. Sometimes you're going to get something wrong, or something might die and you'll question everything you did and it's important to be able to frame your thinking in a way that's helpful to move forward rather than detrimental.

2534,pixiegurly,"LVT here. 

I think it's really common for techs to be wary, suspicious, and on guard around new grad drs. Enough come into the clinic where the techs have been established, and start with a big ego , disregard our input, and honestly, make mistakes that cause harm. It's absolutely not a reason to be disrespectful tho, but that's definitely how it manifests in some. In which case just demonstrating respect and listening and considering input and *letting us do our part of the job*. 


The other thing is, a TON of techs have a huge chip on their shoulder. Especially, IME, OJT trained ones without a license. I think it's just because of how in general our skills (as are y'all's) are so devalued by society, clients, and also Drs. Plus all the other bs that is in veterinary medicine. When I was new to ER and recently graduated, I had a very skillful experienced OJT tech tell me I wasn't a real tech and my license was just a piece of paper bc I didn't have the same experience. 🙄 And I always valued and respected those with more experience than me. When he said that, I quickly shut it down with no, I have a license I AM a tech, and if he liked he could call me a baby tech bc I'm new and fine with that term. We didn't have a problem after that. I've also seen some say an LVT wasn't an LVT bc they had been outta practice for a while and were rusty on skills. Any excuse to be 'better than.' like crabs in a bucket. It's dumb. 


If directly talking to the tech and asking them hey, what's with you refusing to call me Dr, what can I do to make you feel more comfortable working with me and respecting my title and schooling? (Bc asking like that, in the 'what can I do' way is far less likely to put someone on offense, and may even cause them to consider their role in the relationship.) if that doesn't work, talk to the manager or HR or lead tech or supervisor or lead Dr or whomever about the issue so they can handle it.",lvt think really common techs wary suspicious guard around new grad drs enough come clinic techs established start big ego disregard input honestly make mistakes cause harm absolutely reason disrespectful tho thats definitely manifests case demonstrating respect listening considering input letting us part job thing ton techs huge chip shoulder especially ime ojt trained ones without license think general skills yalls devalued society clients also drs plus bs veterinary medicine new er recently graduated skillful experienced ojt tech tell wasnt real tech license piece paper bc didnt experience always valued respected experience said quickly shut license tech liked could call baby tech bc im new fine term didnt problem ive also seen say lvt wasnt lvt bc outta practice rusty skills excuse better like crabs bucket dumb directly talking tech asking hey whats refusing call dr make feel comfortable working respecting title schooling bc asking like way far less likely put someone offense may even cause consider role relationship doesnt work talk manager hr lead tech supervisor lead dr whomever issue handle,veterinarian,0,veterinarian

2545,Poo_Poo_Palms,"So because the animal world if quite unregulated, at least in the US, there is really no such thing as an animal behaviorist or cat behaviorist from a legal standpoint. The term behaviorist is unregulated, so anyone can call themselves a cat/dog/animal behaviorist regardless of their credentials.

The only regulated term is ***veterinary behaviorist.*** They are veterinarian who have completed a three year residency in behavior. They are the clinical experts of animal behavior. I would say among the veterinarian, these are considered the true ""behaviorists"", outside of the non-clinical research/PhD realm.

The legitimacy of the credentials for *other* ""behaviorists"" is completely up to the consumer of their services. None require state licenses, licensing examinations, continuing education (legally), etc. There are some more respected societies, such as American Veterinary Society Of Animal Behavior (AVSAB), that recognize some credentials as more legitimate than others, but again this isn't legally regulated.

There is nothing stopping me from starting a website called [animalbehaviortraining.com](https://animalbehaviortraining.com), uploading some lectures and quizzes, providing a certificate for feline behavior mastery (CFBM) and stopping you from putting CFBM after your name. Honestly, Animal Behavior Institute looks exactly like an example of this.

2. **Customer Service:** Emphasize your experience in assisting pet owners with financial transactions, such as processing payments for services rendered, explaining pricing and billing information, and addressing any concerns or questions they may have. This showcases your ability to communicate effectively and handle financial transactions professionally.

3. **Inventory Management:** Discuss how you managed inventory of medical supplies, medications, and pet care products, including monitoring stock levels, placing orders, and tracking expenses. This illustrates your ability to manage resources efficiently and control costs, which is essential in finance roles.

4. **Budgeting and Cost Control:** Describe how you assisted in budgeting for veterinary supplies and equipment, as well as monitoring expenses to ensure they stayed within budgetary constraints. This demonstrates your understanding of budgeting principles and your ability to manage costs effectively.

5. **Data Analysis:** Highlight any experience you have with analyzing data related to animal care, such as patient demographics, treatment outcomes, or financial performance metrics. This shows your analytical skills and ability to derive insights from data, which are valuable in finance roles.

2603,Outside_Cap1540,"Tough decision! Personally, I would say that if you have been on track to go into the veterinary field, I would continue with that. Your boyfriend and his family shouldn't interfere with your personal decisions, but I can understand why you'd consider them. While I agree that paying off debt from Med School may be easier, you have different options in both fields.


For example, you could continue your education after becoming a doctor and choose a specialty. There are board certified veterinary ophthalmologists, neurologists and etc. Those professions pay more than the average DVM profession. You also have the option of working with other Veterinarians or starting your own practice. There are also holistic veterinary hospitals that use Chinese medicine and acupuncture as part of their approach to animal care.


For Medical school, you have the option of getting an M.D. or D.O. Similarly to the holistic veterinary area, a D.O. learns a more holistic approach to medicine. Both are still regarded as medical doctors and treated the same way in practice, but a patient may prefer one over the other.


There are a lot less Schools of Veterinary Medicine compared to Medical Colleges. That may be something you have to take into consideration. You have to ask yourself how far you would be willing to relocate in order to attend the colleges you're accepted to.


Also, are you enjoying your internships and pre-Vet research? Or would you rather be doing something involving human medicine?


In my experience, learning complicated material is easier if your interests are focused in that area. Either way, both professions pay well. I think you should go with the decision that would make you the happiest. There will always be pros and cons in any career, but you don't want a job that you dread going to when you wake up. Take the route that you would feel the best about making a difference in.

2631,TekelTroubadour,"First off, I am sorry that you’re dealing with this sort of treatment at work. I’m sure it is very frustrating and will eventually lead to resentment and more negativity about your work environment. 

I can share my experience as someone who worked in the veterinary industry for over a decade. I worked at a couple of small animal practices, then large animal, and, eventually, emergency medicine during college to even out my resume for a potential vet school application. All of these clinics taught me different things, but the emergency clinic probably expanded my knowledge and experience the most due to the nature of the things being treated and fast paced environment. Ironically, the ER was also the final piece of the puzzle that led me to realize attending vet school would not be in my best interest long term. 

I should note that during my time in undergrad, I saw many of my piers (from shared classes and major) get accepted to vet school, attend, and eventually graduate and practice. So, I am aware of their experiences as new grads, and a lot of their initial success as vets depended on where they were hired. There is a vast scale of the perceived respect given to new grads that varies from a vet going back to work at a clinic they may have previously been employed at where they are known/their work ethic is understood, versus, say, someone going into large animal medicine without any experience working with farm animals until vet school. There is a certain period of time that will vary among both individual practices and specialty in which the new grad is expected to show a certain amount of reverence towards the other doctors (and even experienced techs) because they are still considered to be in a learning phase of how to transition from student to practicing doctor. 

This is not to say that you shouldn’t be respected in your own right for your accomplishments as well as knowledge and experience. As many others have pointed out, the tech refusing to use your doctor prefix is in the wrong, and you should address this with them directly or through management channels. 

Unfortunately, there can be stigmas in the industry related to age and gender. Despite being a female dominated field, there can be misogyny even among women with the misconception that a female doctor has to work harder to gain the same respect that a male counterpart (equal in every way) gets by default. This disparity can also be seen in a young new grad that is working with techs that may be older or have more time spent in the industry. This could be something at play with the tech that won’t refer to you as “Doctor —“. This doesn’t excuse their behavior, but it can be difficult for some people to use titles of authority with people that are younger than them.",first sorry youre dealing sort treatment work im sure frustrating eventually lead resentment negativity work environment share experience someone worked veterinary industry decade worked couple small animal practices large animal eventually emergency medicine college even resume potential vet school application clinics taught different things emergency clinic probably expanded knowledge experience due nature things treated fast paced environment ironically er also final piece puzzle led realize attending vet school would best interest long term note time undergrad saw many piers shared classes major get accepted vet school attend eventually graduate practice aware experiences new grads lot initial success vets depended hired vast scale perceived respect given new grads varies vet going back work clinic may previously employed knowntheir work ethic understood versus say someone going large animal medicine without experience working farm animals vet school certain period time vary among individual practices specialty new grad expected show certain amount reverence towards doctors even experienced techs still considered learning phase transition student practicing doctor say shouldnt respected right accomplishments well knowledge experience many others pointed tech refusing use doctor prefix wrong address directly management channels unfortunately stigmas industry related age gender despite female dominated field misogyny even among women misconception female doctor work harder gain respect male counterpart equal every way gets default disparity also seen young new grad working techs may older time spent industry could something play tech wont refer doctor doesnt excuse behavior difficult people use titles authority people younger,0,0,others

It’s important that the title usage is consistent across the team to avoid confusion on the client’s end.

I’m going to be confused about who the vets are, versus who the techs are, and as to who I should be talking to about which topics. 

I know uniforms may vary, but if I’m a client that doesn’t know what the uniforms mean, again, this inconsistency would leave me confused as to who was who. 

A confused client is a client that’s going to forget about the key information given by the vet, or who is going to forget about 

And…from a client perspective…

If somebody does notice the power dynamic play going on, and the inconsistent usage of language, it makes the entire practice look messy and unprofessional.

My big dream is to travel around the world and work with wildlife, specifically doing emergency surgery or surgery in general. However I understand that may seem unrealistic due to the competiveness of this career, so at the end of the day i'm keeping my options open. 

 I do have a long-term plan to help me move towards my big goal, however I feel like there is so much more I can do right now that I don't know about. 

So here is my current plan and how it's going;

1. I'm graduating highschool early, sometime within the next couple months. Due to this, I plan on starting classes at my local college until I can transfer to a 4 year university. Then, I will get a bachelers in bioligy. (I still dont know much about college, so any tips PLEASE give.)

2. To start off my career with some early expeirence, I volunteer with my local shelter.

There was a sudden proliferation of professional schools offering PsyD degrees to practically anyone willing to pay the $200k+ tuition. Prior to this, the vast majority of psychologists obtained PhD degrees and funded their education through grants or teaching. 

The PhD programs typically had class sizes of 4-10 people. The PsyD programs are packed to the brim (not sure on the exact numbers, maybe the modal PsyD program is around 50+ per class?)

As a result, the field is now overwhelmed by too many PsyD recipients who have worse training and higher debt burdens. This has driven down the reimbursement for psychology services nationwide.

I've been a tech for 3 years now. I applied to vet school this year and got rejected from all of them. And that's with all of my experience (gp and er) and excellent grades and extra curriculars. I'm going to apply again and hope for the best. But honestly if I don't get in this second time applying I don't know if I'll try again.

2676,Which-Dragonfly1265,"I'm glad to see colleagues who have an interest in this and think it is an important issue. Obviously it is complex issue and individuals/groups that have a financial stake in it often don't have the best interests of our professions at heart. Here are some other thoughts I have on the matter that I didn't elaborate on above.

1. We are a small profession. That means our educational institutions don't have the luxury to just produce veterinarians. That is, of course, the primary goal but quality institutions also support significant research activities to advance the state of medicine, train interns/residents/graduate students, perform outreach activities, etc. None of these new schools do this to a significant degree which hurts our profession. If a vet school popped up at Columbia or Harvard, I suppose it would be a different issue.
2. At some point, the expansion will lead us down the route of the legal profession. Tons of schools with only the graduates of ""top tier"" schools able to find employment out of schools as well as internships or residencies. Human medicine is somewhat insulated from this as the number of practicing physicians is limited by the number of residency positions NOT the number of graduating physicians/medical schools. I DO realize that a pedigree can help get a human residency but it is a different playing field. I don't know how dentistry is fairing due to this phenomenon. Are there too many dental schools?
3. The profession can largely blame the AVMA and COE for this situation. The first distributive was initially denied accreditation and in response, sued the AVMA. Mark Cushing was a part of that. The AVMA caved. Let me be clear, there are positives to the distributive model and if the institution also prioritizes research, training, etc, then they can be an asset. University of Calgary is a great example of this. University of Arizona could be one as well but they have their own problems (namely poor NAVLE scores).
4. Debt - Private schools that have distributive models don't try to reduce costs by not having a teaching hospital. They just charge the student market rates. This is criminal. Teaching hospitals are a MAJOR expense to a school. Do these new schools paying the offsite rotation hospitals an equivalent amount to running a teaching hospital annually? I doubt it. This is just compounding the problem of debt for our students.
5. Like many have commented, the goal of training DVMs to fill rural positions is ludicrous. This is a ploy parroted by the new programs to use as justification. Unless rural position provide incentive with higher salaries or loan repayment, solving rural shortage by producing more DVMs is not going to work.

What can we do about it? I don't know. There is a lot of money involved and key players in academic leadership (deans) and the AVMA stand to benefit from moving into the private sector and helping groups like the animal policy group. So they don't rock the boat. There is no money to be made for apposing it and no ones got time to do it. It has to be out of passion and love for our profession. But here are some thoughts.

1. Discussions amongst interest groups. Things like discussions on VIN, local and state VMAs, speciality colleges, conferences, etc. But there is also something to be said about having this issue blow up on social media, which is why the younger generation of DVMs is so important. I'm old and not social media savvy. Getting a post to reddit was difficult for me. But I've seen the power of ""not one more vet"" (NOMV). Maybe something like that could help.
2. Getting involved and being vocal. This can be with state VMAs, the AVMA, etc. Getting involved in the COE. Writing letters to editor for JAVMA.

Any other ideas?",im glad see colleagues interest think important issue obviously complex issue individualsgroups financial stake often dont best interests professions heart thoughts matter didnt elaborate small profession means educational institutions dont luxury produce veterinarians course primary goal quality institutions also support significant research activities advance state medicine train internsresidentsgraduate students perform outreach activities etc none new schools significant degree hurts profession vet school popped columbia harvard suppose would different issue point expansion lead us route legal profession tons schools graduates top tier schools able find employment schools well internships residencies human medicine somewhat insulated number practicing physicians limited number residency positions number graduating physiciansmedical schools realize pedigree help get human residency different playing field dont know dentistry fairing due phenomenon many dental schools profession largely blame avma coe situation first distributive initially denied accreditation response sued avma mark cushing part avma caved let clear positives distributive model institution also prioritizes research training etc asset university calgary great example university arizona could one well problems namely poor navle scores debt private schools distributive models dont try reduce costs teaching hospital charge student market rates criminal teaching hospitals major expense school new schools paying offsite rotation hospitals equivalent amount running teaching hospital annually doubt compounding problem debt students like many commented goal training dvms fill rural positions ludicrous ploy parroted new programs use justification unless rural position provide incentive higher salaries loan repayment solving rural shortage producing dvms going work dont know lot money involved key players academic leadership deans avma stand benefit moving private sector helping groups like animal policy group dont rock boat money made apposing ones got time passion love profession thoughts discussions amongst interest groups things like discussions vin local state vmas speciality colleges conferences etc also something said issue blow social media younger generation dvms important im old social media savvy getting post reddit difficult ive seen power one vet nomv maybe something like could help getting involved vocal state vmas avma etc getting involved coe writing letters editor javma ideas,0,0,others

2689,usernameTH1S,"I agree with the principle of this letter, but devils advocate, some of this is just not really true. At least not everywhere. I went through internship and finished residency last year, and have also been part of the intern selection committee several times including this past year.
- my residency was private practice with expectation to work for them after, and I did not get a low ball offer. I interviewed and looked at some other non corp positions just to see, and they made the same or worse offers. I felt like my hospital really wanted me to stay and was actually very competitive even with the expectation I would stay. 
- salaries: definitely suck but outside of academia, seem to be getting better every year. VCAs are paying interns $80k I believe which is definitely livable. I’m biased bc in California intern salaries are regulated by min wage laws but definitely not true everywhere so for sure could be better. 
- Quality of life: also can definitely suck, but my impression is there is a consistent trend towards more sustainable intern life. My hospital (and I think all programs in the area) have 2 guaranteed days off, and actually get 3 in a row off when they are on ER (they work 4 days/week). Don’t get me wrong there is certainly room for improvement but it is definitely better even than when I was an intern. 
- selection process: I can only speak to the intern selection but it is 100% merit based. I put in probably 30 hours each VIRMP season reviewing/interviewing applicants and then a huge meeting to decide on rank order.

2710,laserxop,"Speaking from a government vet perspective. 

Not only did I go through a similar thing (not feeling like I was cut out to do clinical work), I actually had a greater interest in Veterinary public health and pathology. You said it's mostly an ""office job"". Federal? State? Or are you outside the US? 
I, myself, took the official veterinarian route. 
I actually started off working for the government of NZ where not only did I carry out verification of sanitary procedures, was also in charge of handling animal welfare issues and conducted compliance visits at a number of farms. 
The work life balance was pretty sweet indeed. 
I did end up moving ""into an office"" eventually where I was dealing with animal imports and animal import products. It was mostly policy but, again, offered further work life balance. 

Fast forward to 2022 and I am State side working for the USDA as a Public Health Veterinarian. If this is the govt job you are talking about, it is certainly not an office job... haha. I guess it does depend on the location but I would say it does put your knowledge to test. Particularly pathology. 
I'm no longer in that role and, yeah, now I'm in a role that's a bit more removed from Veterinary medicine. One that still involves a lot of technical skills and whole lot of soft skills. Still, I view my current role as a stepping stone. There are definitely roles that do require clinical knowledge through APHIS as well. 

Not sure if you were one of those that dreamed of working in a veterinary clinic. That wasn't quite me. So I at least wanted to share some perspective on the government vet role. It may not be your thing, but there are definitely a lot of opportunities through government vet roles. 

Goodluck with whatever you decide! :)",speaking government vet perspective go similar thing feeling like cut clinical work actually greater interest veterinary public health pathology said mostly office job federal state outside us took official veterinarian route actually started working government nz carry verification sanitary procedures also charge handling animal welfare issues conducted compliance visits number farms work life balance pretty sweet indeed end moving office eventually dealing animal imports animal import products mostly policy offered work life balance fast forward state side working usda public health veterinarian govt job talking certainly office job haha guess depend location would say put knowledge test particularly pathology im longer role yeah im role thats bit removed veterinary medicine one still involves lot technical skills whole lot soft skills still view current role stepping stone definitely roles require clinical knowledge aphis well sure one dreamed working veterinary clinic wasnt quite least wanted share perspective government vet role may thing definitely lot opportunities government vet roles goodluck whatever decide,veterinarian,0,veterinarian
2711,Naamch3,"Imposter syndrome sure seems to hit a greater # of people in this recent crop of college grads. I wonder why? But for your purposes please don’t let it stop you. Most others in a range of graduating years near you had the Covid impact as well. I have two suggestions. #1 pursue your dream vet job and let nothing stop you…especially yourself. You will grow old regretting it. Knowing you gave up on your dream b/c you lacked confidence will gnaw at you forever and could destroy your mental health over time. Once you get your vet job and are treating patients I doubt the vet practice will allow you to be a sole decision maker on critical cases at first. You and they will want to have an experienced voice in both diagnosis then treatment. Also, be open during your interview. Let them know how much you want the job and ask about mentorship.  Like any medical position a credible veterinary practice will want to assess you before they allow you to fly solo. It might help if you interview at larger practices where they might have more mentoring options. Be upfront about your nervousness. They will appreciate it and tell you that it is normal. If you get an offer from a veterinary practice that doesn’t give you the confidence that there will be mentorship as well as various checks to ensure you cause no outlandish harm then just keep interviewing. Please don’t let that voice in your head cause you to take a desk job and god forbid you take a government job. That sounds like a recipe for a lifetime of regret and pain. I don’t know you but I assume you are better than a government job.

Option #2, if you really are paralyzed by your imposter syndrome then what about interviewing for nurse or technician jobs at vet practices? Or vet / doctor assistant? I apologize for not knowing the right vocabulary for these positions. Sure the pay won’t be what you could make as a veterinary doctor but it provides for a slower start and a longer runway to get your feet under you. As for the economics, assuming the ‘nurse’ job builds you into having the confidence to flip to veterinary doctor then the lifetime earnings will far exceed the giving up option of pursuing that banal government desk job.

Hope this was helpful. A rule of thumb I often use is this, you have only two people in this world to make proud of you. Those two people are your eight year old self and your eighty year old self.

I’m a senior in high school and I’m having a hard time figuring out where to go to college considering cost as well as what will look best and be the best route to vet school. I’ve been looking at colleges around the country that have pre-vet programs and I’d love to do those, but they’re so expensive and I really don’t want to get into a lot of debt so early on in life. Recently I’ve been looking at one of the nearby community colleges and they have a vet tech program where I can get an associates degree in Veterinary technology after getting some prerequisites done beforehand to actually get into the program. I know that what vet techs and vets do aren’t nearly the same nor is the necessary education which is what my concerns are. I do want to get a bachelors degree because I don’t know how far just an associates degree could get me as well as if I go to vet school there are many required courses that I most definitely won’t finish in just 2 years with an associates degree. Or should I just stick to going to a 4 year with a pre-vet program?

Sorry this is kind of wordy, but if anyone has any advice or any I’d love to hear it!!

If you don't know or fully understand something right this moment, you still have the potential to learn it later on (this isn't a race to the graduation line). I'm sure you've heard plenty of not comparing yourself to others, but for real, focus on how you can feel confident with what you know. Your program should lay enough groundwork for you but if there's areas you think your knowledge is lacking, take those thoughts and channel it into ways to bridge your perceived knowledge gaps rather than disparage yourself.

Reviewing earlier semesters could be a good starting point to see where your basic knowledge could use some brushing up. Online resources like Merck's Manual, Clinician's Brief, DVM360 (that also has a YouTube channel), VIN/Veterinary Partner, eclinpath.com are fairly accessible and can help you explore things more thoroughly. Even consider webinars or if you can attend a conference with lectures on areas you want to know more about. 

It can become a vicious cycle of constantly measuring yourself with others and I think coming to terms with the fact there will be always be others who know more and less than you can be difficult; especially in an academically competitive, professional programs. Try and frame this more about wanting to improve for yourself rather than feeling like you need to 'catch up' to others and I think you'll have a healthier approach to learning and practicing as a future doctor.

There were also many problems causing some of the mainstay services like IM and Sx to completely shut down for weeks at a time.

2750,meghanhoe,"1. Do NOT lose sleep to study. Pick a time of day you will be done (I made it earlier and earlier as school went on 😂 but vowed I would never study so late that it would take away from sleep!)

2. Be open to changing your mind about your career. I was very set on internship and residency but realized that GP has a lot to offer too should not be undervalued compared to academia (basically don’t feel like you are not as high achieving because becoming a DVM alone is such a huge accomplishment and a ton of work/knowledge is required for it too). 

3. Have a small circle and do not feel like you need to be around people who cause drama. There is zero extra energy to put up with all of that and I found that the smaller my circle was the more peace I had. 

4. Find other hobbies unrelated to vet med and make time for it every day. Doesn’t matter what it is, you just need complete separation from it to quell the burn out. 

5. Get involved in clubs like HSVMA/other clubs that allow students to practice surgery, hugely helpful before junior surgery starts to have some idea of the common procedures :)

This past December I scheduled in-home hospice for my dog, Roxxie. We were able to get her on meds to make her comfortable and set up a plan for her care. We were connected with a hospice nurse and the doctor checked in regularly. I was able to plan for Roxxie’s euthanasia at home and it was a beautiful and peaceful experience. We gave her all of the food she couldn’t have during her life (chocolate cake, cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets, etc.) and she was around her family and our other pets. The doctor gave Roxxie a subQ sedative while she was laying on her favorite couch with our other dog next to her. The doctor waited until Roxxie was fully sedated before placing an IVC and euthanizing her. My sister and I carried Roxxie out to the doctor’s car and covered her with her favorite blanket.
I am very close with several of our DVMs and they love what they do. Most of them work four to five days in a row and have said having two or three days off in a row in the best way for them to decompress. Some of our DVMs have never worked in a clinic and went straight to end-of-life care after graduating. If you have the passion for hospice and euthanasia, you’d probably find a position like that very fulfilling. 
Again- I’m definitely not a veterinarian and I’m sorry that was so long. Good luck in whatever you decide! ♥️

2763,Jazzyhoss,"Are you worried because you’re an Island student coming into Purdue? Most of my island friends did great and had a decent experience. There was some prejudice against island students from staff (more technicians than anyone) but the admin during my year have Island students the same name badges as us Purdue students so it was harder to determine. 

Most rotations are very work-like hours. Internal medicine, surgery, and emergency/critical care rotations have the longest hours, sometimes with night treatments. Learning about other schools now, I’d say Purdue often uses its fourth year vet students as cheap tech labor. On one hand you do get some decent training and exposure to more cases. On the other hand doing eye drops in ECC at 11pm isn’t really what you as a vet will be doing post graduation. So look at the treatment plans of your patients and try and understand the whys. A lot too depends on how helpful your blockmates are and teamwork. My blockmates were always great about pitching in to get things done. 

I really enjoyed my Ancillary rotation. The hours were great and the workload wasn’t over the top and we saw a lot of sad, but interesting cases.

2770,Master-Arm-4753,"Hi  I recently just got into Western University of Health Science-Veterinary School in California. This was my second cycle applying and I took a gap year in between. 

During my gap year, I took some post bacc classes and gained more veterinary experience in order to stay competitive. 

My GPA ended  up being around  a 3.4.

I was interviewed previously from Western in my first cycle applying, however, was not offered admissions after the interview process.



This second cycle, I was referred to Alex Leventhal to help me do mock interviews. Alex was so great to work with and was very detailed on what graduate schools are looking for in their applicants. He is a Harvard grad and specializes in various grad school applications.

Because of our mock interviews, I was more confident in my actual interview and felt that I gave better answers compared to my first cycle interview with Western.



I also appreciated that Alex was able to help me with the essay portion of the Vet School applications. I liked his style of getting to know me and being able to use that information to help format my personal statement and supplemental essays. I would highly recommend working with Alex if you need help with your essays and interviews.



I will leave his website and email here

2816,cheesefeast,"What a horrible take. In real life you can take 10 minutes to consider your options. Or you can tell the owner hey- this is out of the ordinary, let me go reference some resources. Or I do have other patients to see, I will continue to work with you on between getting these other pets out of here. People generally understand when they have a sick pet that you might not get a diagnosis upon exam only. You can also have pets drop off. You can also call the next day after discussion with your mentor, etc with a plan moving forward. You really think that the NAVLE is questions about calculating epinephrine and that’s what they can’t pass? Just make an emergency drug sheet and you’ll never have to calculate that on the spot ever again- and if you don’t, you should be using a drug manual to be sure your dose is correct. But when you see a chicken for the first time in 5 years with pox marks on its comb- you can go look that up. NAVLE is full of questions that not everyone will remain brushed up on- that makes it challenging. There’s so much info about stuff that feels very irrelevant to someone who is not going to practice medicine on reptiles, avian species, swine, ruminants, horses, and small animal AND practice public health. Need to look something up? You can do that. Need to call the reference lab and discuss the case with the internist? You can do that. Unless it emergency stabilization of a patient, there is time to make accommodations for themselves.

2839,Murphalurf,"A thing to keep in mind with the hands off corporations: they're hands off because they don't know and refuse to manage individual practices.  This applies especially to some of these newer groups that started with venture capitalists, most have no experience in vet med.  The corp that I worked for was so hands off that their regional manager wasn't allowed to visit more than once a quarter unless it was a crisis.  What this does is create unfamiliarity to each clinic and wasted time describing needs and wants over and over again.  What they do know is how to buy a clinic, not improve or maintain it beyond basic management or lobby face lifts.

Another thing to keep in mind is a lot of these hands off corporations don't change previous clinic benefits, so the benefits could vary from clinic to clinic.  This is great during the beginning buyout because nothing really changes, but it also eludes any infrastructure to create a plan to improve benefits.  Wild situations of staff getting a 5k a year bonus vs a larger clinic handing out $100, differences in how staff discounts are applied, etc.  

They keep clinics where they were when they bought them out.  Getting improvements in benefits outside of what the Corp allows all clinics is impossible, even when other clinics could have better benefits than the others.  

To be clear, you don't want red tape and micro management in your practice, but at the end of the day the corps will demand the price increases and dictate raise allowances with practices they have no idea who they are.  Clinics that need a lot of help don't get the support they need and you tend to compete for staff with sister clinics in the area.

This isn't a case of you not being cut out to be a vet. You have fallen into a very bad first job with a very bad first boss, which unfortunately happens a lot in vet med. I promise you, there are good owners and good clinics out there that you should definitely explore before giving up on general practice altogether.  

As far as this nasty boss being intent on burning you out during your 2 month notice, I would recommend 2 things. First, if you have an employment contract, re-read it very carefully. There is likely some language in there regarding a ""reasonable workload"" or something very similar. With all of the stress, anxiety and mental health problems you have accumulated since starting this position, I feel you would have a strong legal case to say your workload is unreasonable for someone of your experience level.  

Secondly, I would definitely chat with an employment lawyer. I noticed you're in Canada in another comment, I know the OVMA provides free initial legal consults, I'm sure other provinces associations have something similar, if not, pay a few hundred dollars to talk to an employment lawyer. This should give you a more finite idea of the actual repercussions of leaving before your notice period is up.

2926,step1step2profit,"For cardio, the best path is probably to do an academic internship at a place with a well known rotating internship and cardiology program. I haven't been in the match for awhile, but it seems like interns from CSU, Tufts, Ohio, TAMU, NC State, and some others were the most likely to match their general rotating interns to a residency. So I can't answer your question about externship vs research program directly; go for whichever one is most likely to get you in a top academic internship.

That being said, while it's great to know that you want to do cardiology so early in your career, make sure to have an open mind going into the rotating internship. Your impression of a specialty will likely change once you step into your role as a clinician. It's also important to first be a good clinician in all aspects, not just cardiology.

2939,PureBreadTed,">I’m also worried about coming across as unprofessional if I show emotion during a pet euthanasia.

I can't speak to how you'll come across in vet school. I've also only been in this industry for a few months.

that being said, in this time (I work at an urgent care) I've seen two vets cry due to completely heart wrenching cases.

first case was with a new-to-us vet. this case was not euthanasia, but unfortunately ended similarly. the dog came in limping. we'd administered pain meds via IV (iirc) and the dog immediately went into arrest. we attempted CPR but were unsuccessful. when we broke the news to his owner, it was gut wrenching. we were all in tears because it was completely unexpected. Dr later says he believes the limping was due to a clot and we may have unfortunately pushed the clot out of position while giving meds leading to cardiopulmonary arrest.

second case was a euth. an older dog came in because she got cut on the farm. she was a ""farm dog"". at the point the finally came in, she'd been bleeding for over five hours and had stalled her owners T-shirt in an attempt to help her clot. our DR was immediately suspicious and asked about rat poison. owner called a family member who was able to check and she did unfortunately get into it. while we were waiting to hear back from ASPCA poison control so we could transfer her to ER, our DR was demonstrating how to use an ultrasound for a new tech. The DR realized there was a lot of free-floating liquid in her abdomen. Dr asked to do an X-ray because she was older and intact. She unfortunately had pyometra. However, the owner was willing to pay for the expensive surgery, so she is good, right? wrong. by happenstance, the X-ray also captured nodes on her lungs. the owner had no idea she had cancer. this case was heart wrenching because despite our best efforts and an owners willingness to do whatever it took to get her better, she wouldn't be able to do so. in the end, we were all feeling it because it felt like everything was against this sweet girl getting better.

my point here is it is normal to have emotions in this job. we can't always be stoic like it doesn't affect us. those emotions make us human and show we care about the animals we are looking after.",im also worried coming across unprofessional show emotion pet euthanasia cant speak youll come across vet school ive also industry months said time work urgent care ive seen two vets cry due completely heart wrenching cases first case newtous vet case euthanasia unfortunately ended similarly dog came limping wed administered pain meds via iv iirc dog immediately went arrest attempted cpr unsuccessful broke news owner gut wrenching tears completely unexpected dr later says believes limping due clot may unfortunately pushed clot position giving meds leading cardiopulmonary arrest second case euth older dog came got cut farm farm dog point finally came shed bleeding five hours stalled owners tshirt attempt help clot dr immediately suspicious asked rat poison owner called family member able check unfortunately get waiting hear back aspca poison control could transfer er dr demonstrating use ultrasound new tech dr realized lot freefloating liquid abdomen dr asked xray older intact unfortunately pyometra however owner willing pay expensive surgery good right wrong happenstance xray also captured nodes lungs owner idea cancer case heart wrenching despite best efforts owners willingness whatever took get better wouldnt able end feeling felt like everything sweet girl getting better point normal emotions job cant always stoic like doesnt affect us emotions make us human show care animals looking,0,0,others

2974,Katmaybeck,"I became a licensed vet tech in 2016 and I worked for Banfield for 2 years as one of my first jobs. Sure I gained a tremendous amount of experience but also became aware of the sketchy malpractice the vets were doing there. They had really weak anesthetic protocols and literally used TORB/MIDAZ premed for every surgery- spay, neuter, dentals, even tho butorphanol has the weakest analgesia and they were afraid of using hydromorphone thinking it was this scary drug when in fact it is an excellent choice for premed sedation and pain control. I witnessed so many pets waking up in pain bc the vets follow a cookie cutter formula and are afraid to practice quality medicine. 

They never educated the owners or showed them the teeth in the room so they were clueless on day of dental, no forewarning on what periodontal disease is. They waited until pet under and charted to try to call and often the client had no idea they needed to be available so they wouldn’t answer and we would have to wake up the pet. If the owner did happen to answer, the conversation was always a surprise for the client, they would be shocked at the extra cost and decline bc they don’t understand they needed “additional services”. If the vets did their job and educated and provided estimates prior there would be a lot more compliance and quality treatment, but not the case here. There was one doctor that hated dentals and extractions so much he would purposely avoid contacting the owner about the periodontal disease. He would call once and then immediately tell me to turn off when they didn’t answer, did not wait 5 min or try again. One time he waited until after I took my 1 hr lunch and came back to take his, even tho we were supposed to lunch together and do another dental after bc it was a longer one. Well he was trying to stall for time to avoid having to do extractions. I had to advocate for the pet and tell him the owner requested full mouth dental X-rays (even tho I had convinced her to do them at check in bc they were not included at the time for Banfield dentals). Well lo and behold the dog had like 9 tooth root abscesses and he is immediately pissed that he has to start pulling teeth. We of course don’t finish in time and have to wake up without doing them all. Another time I was cleaning/charting and told him both back molars were a little loose. He comes and checks them and think one is more loose than the other but I didn’t agree. Well he just decides to pick up the drill and start taking out this tooth without consent from owner, no dental block that I recall, and just did it in a forceful way out of anger. It was extremely alarming…

They do assembly line exams where they would just flip the lip of the canine tooth and that was it. Didn’t do a thorough check of back teeth or incisors which are often worse in small dogs. Even the medical director was in it for the money. She did the fastest “exams” I’ve ever seen and did not chart dentals properly. One time a relief vet was there and was saying how she always counts the teeth and discovered the 311 was dead but the medical director does not normally chart that thoroughly and seemed surprised (but actually this relief vet was doing her job properly and how it should be). Another time the medical director refused to provide solutions for this Yorkie with a heart murmur and horrible teeth bc she was “not gonna risk putting it under”. But heart murmur is not an automatic disqualification from anesthesia. She could have referred to specialty dentist. I took it upon myself to leave her a voicemail with information if she wanted to see a cardiologist/specialist bc the pet was suffering and needed full mouth extractions. But the vets didn’t care about the pets pain and oral disease there. 

Before they installed the digital dental X-rays we had analog and had to use dip tanks so we would rarely take them. I remember cleaning pets teeth with severe gingival recession, very deep pockets and furcation exposure. And we would just clean them and wake up. These same pets got dentals here for years and then when we finally get X-rays discover 9 tooth abscess. So imagine how many pets were never getting proper extractions of diseased teeth and just getting them “cleaned”. That does not get rid of the pain and infection so those pets all continued to suffer from Banfield their whole lives!! Sadly this is not just a Banfield problem, but a nationwide problem for practices that still do not offer digital dental X-rays OR who still think it’s ok to take dental X-rays “as needed” when they think a tooth is bad. But in reality X-rays are the only way to diagnose pathology 100% so don’t go anywhere that doesn’t take full mouth X-rays for every dental!

I soon after found a veterinary dental practice and left Banfield. I would NEVER recommend anyone to work there or bring their pet there. I felt the pets were neglected in the kennels for hours, received incomplete physical exams and substandard treatment in general. The whole culture of Banfield is about pushing the most amount of pets to be seen in a day, maximizing the wellness plan signups, and a greedy profit driven agenda. Literally they would post signs on the walls that said “12 drop offs before 12” or something like that. Techs had to often pull blood and place catheters by themselves bc people would call out or quit all the time. It was just utter chaos at all times.

Obviously this was a single Banfield horror story but I know it’s not the only one. I also did a relief shift once at another Banfield and it was soooo disorganized and clutter everywhere. They also NEVER entered the lab results for anything in house I noticed- cytologies, skin scrapes, FeLV tests in the computer. I’m not sure how they were able to get by with this?

Hey guys 
I had written in another post detailing about my aspirations to become a vet one day and especially work more with wildlife, I still wouldn’t mind working with other animals as well. 
I am currently a senior in undergraduate and my current gpa is 2.44 , I have 2 semesters left , I am expected to graduate fall 2024. I am worried about how my journey is going so far in veterinary medicine because it hasn’t been the best and I will do my best to keep my story short. I relocated to America from Africa at the age of 13 , idk why I didn’t fully quite know I wanted to be a vet , it’s like I always knew deep inside that my fondness for animals is way deeper and I would always go above and beyond taking care of them the best way I knew how to do it since I was young , especially the stray animals back in my country. Anyway after coming to America , I graduated high school with a 3.9 gpa then went to community college for 2 and a half years where I was focused on international relations and international business , I have always been into humanitarian work as well , fast forward my advisor at the college asked me about how come I have never thought about veterinary medicine and all I do is talk about animals , that’s when it clicked to me that I am in the wrong major and I should pursue veterinary medicine , at this point I was like 21/22 years old. So I graduated from the community college with a decent gpa , I believe it was like a 3.4 and then I applied to do animal science pre vet track at the state university then I later changed it to food science pre vet track. My life started going downhill after freshman year of university and I would say that most of my undergraduate life has not been the best , I experienced a lot of racism , loneliness, depression, getting sick etc , just shit happening and I lost control of myself.  life was just hitting me from all sides and as a result of all that I think it was my sophomore year I started drinking a lot and I ended up getting 2 duis 2 years apart, so now I have a class A misdemeanor on my record. I decided to take a break from school and go back to my parents and work on myself and my life and seek therapy etc

I actually just resumed school this fall , after taking a break for almost 2 years , while I was on break I worked at the humane society and 2 other vet clinics as a vet assistant and I was full time there so I know I have a lot of hours when it comes to that. I have been seeking therapy and taking the alcohol classes and stuff , I have been sober for almost a year now and I know I still have a journey ahead of me fighting alcohol, I am happy to say that I did really well this semester and after everything I have been through , I do see some hope for me in the future , at the same time with a low gpa and 2 duis , am questioning all that 

I am currently 27 years old and I know that I really fucked up my undergraduate, sometimes I wish I could go back to freshman year and start all over and make better choices but I never did. So now that I am expected to graduate in a year , I plan to raise my gpa to atleast a 2.8, I met with my pre vet advisor and we discussed taking courses with more weight that would replace the ones I failed which is like 3/4 classes I think , I know the duis are definitely also another hurdle for me in vet school and career world 

Yes  my story is complicated and fucked up but I am looking for any advice anyone has to give me out there, anyone with similar experience or know anyone who has 2 DUIs and got into vet school or became a vet 

Although 27 feels old and that am super behind , I also know am still young and I don’t plan to apply for vet school anytime soon, I figured I should give it atleast another 2/3-4 years from now especially with my duis 

I am currently stuck on what should I do after getting my bachelors ? Should I just go straight to the work force or pursue a masters and what trajectory should I take so that I can be considered a candidate for veterinary medicine in the future or should I just kiss all of it goodbye since I have no chance whatsoever? 
Also my advisor told me that getting into vet school might be possible in the future but getting a dea license is where things might be challenging. We did a little research on it and we saw that if you are a felon then you are already disqualified from getting it or you would need to plead your case but with a misdemeanor and depending on how long ago it was , there’s a slight hope there but it varies case by case. 

So I know that all of these things won’t be easy for me and I have a lot of hurdles and challenges to overcome in the future.

3048,HiddenJindo,"Hello! Veterinary medicine is an incredibly rewarding career but, in most cases, clinical medicine is quite busy. A successful, well-functioning clinic is typically a busy clinic. It is good that you have had clinical experience already! There are options for lowering your workload but it depends on where you're working, the type of work you're doing, and how much control you have over your schedule.

As far as the US Army HPSP scholarship, financially it is a great deal. The scholarship pays for 3 years of veterinary school. At the same time, you are paid a monthly stipend of \~$2000 per month (greatly varying by your location). In exchange you owe 4 years active duty to the US Army.

An army veterinarian is a unique job. The primary clinical focus of the army veterinarian is to support the health of the military working dog (MWD). The typical army veterinarian performs less clinics than a civilian veterinarian because they will also spend their time doing other tasks such as auditing food facilities (ice cream facilities, bottled water plants, etc) that sell to the military. The history of army veterinarians performing food protection dates back to a time where the Army shipped cadavers (e.g. cattle) by rail as a primary food source for soldiers, and veterinarians were able to judge if animal meat was still consumable or not after transport. Army veterinarians also deploy and provide humanitarian relief.

Depending on where you are assigned in the army, you may do a mix of medicine and food work, or all food work, or all army work. It is a very real possibility that an army veterinarian attached to a deployable unit does not touch an animal patient for 2-3 years.

This fact is a big negative to many army veterinarians who originally became veterinarians because they wanted to work on animals, haha. 

At the end of the day, I think becoming an Army veterinarian for the financial benefits is still worth it because of the incredible cost of veterinary school. But it's important to understand the cost of becoming one, and the resulting time you may lose to 'develop' yourself as a clinician. It's also helpful if you have a personal desire to serve in the military, and not just because you're motivated by the financial benefits.

Feel free to reply or DM me if you'd like to discuss this career further!

Ideally every clinic should have them, and every employee should have their own badge. Try to rotate who takes x-rays to limit exposure. Wear you’re PPE including gloves. Stay out of the primary beam. Use sedation, then you can typically move further away, and get quality x-rays the first shot instead of having to take multiple because of movement etc. Collimate the xray, don’t get the whole pet when the point of interest is a paw.

3138,Zebrasoma,"IMO having worked for a GP who did a lot for the community like that you are unfortunately inviting a lot of problems when you offer credit arrangements and cheap to free vaccine clinics. It devalues the rest of your services and invites a certain type of client. Why would someone pay full price for a vaccine if they can wait till the free clinic? Why would someone pay their bill if they know a credit program exist? When we raised prices to just cover the cost of the supplies people lost their minds. It’s just a harsh reality of the field, people suck and will take advantage of a good thing. That’s why these models of petco vet clinic things work. There are certainly the subset of people who could pay if they would but it’s not the majority. 

I don’t think it’s bad, but even though I want to do good in the world I would have no interest in a job like that because I’ve seen the reality. It would have to be very well run to avoid the pitfalls of barely staying above water and so perhaps it’s worth highlighting that in the job description somehow. Just highlighting all the fluffy things you do may strike concern.   

And as an aside there is a subset of vets (I am one of them) who are not supportive of TNR. We even went over it in school as a debate topic because it’s controversial. There is minimal evidence it’s a good long term control method and it leads to worse outcomes for wildlife and for cats.

3140,sardonicwit,"TAMU vet student here. I'm going to echo what everyone else here has said - no amount of experience in the veterinary field is going to make up for a subpar GPA in admission's eyes. Struggling financially for a few years while you try to apply isn't going to help you in any sense - getting into vet school, getting in a better financial situation, preserving your mental health. It also isn't going to change anything about your application from year to year except that your experience hours will go up, which probably doesn't buy you anything - I suspect that you already have enough experience there that they'll give you sufficient ""points"" in that category as it is.

I'd definitely look for ways to address the GPA issue. What your GPA actually looks like and where you want to apply will probably direct the way you can most effectively do that, but you want to at least consider some possibilities there.

But I'd also give serious thought to changing jobs. Either work as a tech somewhere else if you're able to get a greater diversity of experience that way (say, going from a small animal clinic to one that does production animals/horses/exotics/something else), or change careers entirely. Vet med is primarily a business involving people, so anything that broadens your experience with business and/or people is incredibly valuable in an applicant, even if it isn't vet-related. It also makes you stand out against the thousands of applicants they get from adequate-to-good students who've spent years working as techs.

It’s a pretty straightforward process for any staff that might be unfamiliar with in house machines. They even give you explicit directions on the screen when running dilutions. 

In my clinic we have most of the machines available: catalyst for chemistries/lytes/T4 (takes 10-15 min depending on which tests you’re running), procyte for CBC (takes only a couple minutes), sedivue for UA (I hate the strip reader but LOVE that the sedivue takes pictures of the sample so you can double check for bacteria/crystals/cells- way simpler than staining a UA to read, takes about 5-10 min) , coag for PT/PTT (3-5 min), blood gas values (10 min?? Not as confident on that number because we use it infrequently), and the snap readers. In an ER setting all of them get pretty regular use aside from the blood gas, mostly because the docs just prefer to run those on the istat.

 I'm in Canada and Zoetis doesn't have a local rep that can drop in and help with our machines. Every time I had an issue with Idexx, I'd immediately get an email from our rep offering to come in and assist us. Also, the Idexx staff were friendlier than Zoetis staff.

I am unfamiliar with what additional services Zoetis offers. I already know I can get every test I've already looked up from Idexx. I had started doing SDMA in-house in my senior cat years ago and now we have to send it away. I like how Idexx allows you to build your own panels.

I find Vet Connect easier to use than Zoetis Fuse. I'm not sure if you can access your test results outside of the computers that have Fuse bookmarked on it - but you can with Vet Connect.

I am beginning to wonder if our lack of having a local rep may be why we don't know how to use Zoetis efficiently 😆

The Idexx store has a TON of free items that you can order whenever you want - from culture tubes to free blood tubes to shipping materials. It would always arrive within 48 hours of the order being placed.

The HM5 rotors don't require you to spin the blood before you put them in it, which is nice. The boxes take up more room in the fridge compared to Idexx.

3174,Weasle189,"We actually have both. We have idexx catalyst one , an Abaxis HM 5 (hematology) and an Abaxis vetscan VS2. 


The zoetis (VS2) tests run cheaper and they replace faulty disks so it works out well for the chemistry so long as you have a good rep, we also like that alot of the profiles have electrolytes included rather than separate (clients prefer to pay for one test vs two). The HM5 has a lot of maintenance (running blanks, wash head cleaning and soak cleaning) , if you are running less than 5 tests a day on average I would say it's not worth it and rather get the idexx machine, it also throws a lot of errors on IMHA dogs so those often need a blood smear and manual hct anyway. 


The big advantage of the idexx catalyst one machine is you can run individual slides. We like using just bun/crea to monitor chronic kidney failure and Alkp and Alt to monitor liver cases. It saves a lot of money and makes clients more compliant with follow-up testing. It's also nice to have individual slides if you need to do dilutions for a specific test, usually creatinine (we usually assume if it's too high to read the actual value is irrelevant but there are others that like that option). They are also regularly bringing out new slides and research (waiting on cortisol for Addison's and Cushing's dogs at the moment, rep says in the next year or two)

You get the transcript of the original enquiry, so I usually need to ask a couple of follow up questions.

Other's are asking for nutritional advice, there'a a bit of behaviour, which I find is just too involved for the format, or owners just needing a bit of reassurance. So far, I don't mind it at all. You get to chose the questions you answer, and can accept phone enquires too which pay more, but I've not done that. 

  
The pay structure was not transparent until after my final training, but once you're signed on it's clear what you get paid for each question. Most are $11, some have a bonus attached, and I think with more experience that can go up too. There is no minimum number you are required to answer, but I find if I put a couple of hours aside to sit and dedicate a bit of time to it a couple of times a week, that works well for me.

3198,GrapefruitMango23,"31 yo female here. I agree that this topic is not nearly touched upon enough given the fact that majority of us are women! I graduated in early 2022 and started working full time as a GP vet. I got pregnant a few months after starting and continued working full time. Management and staff were extremely supportive and lightened my caseload as things became harder physically. I was able to take 4-5 months of maternity leave and currently I am back at work full time. My son is about 10 months old now. He is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. 

I do agree that it slowed down my career during my time on maternity leave, but when I returned to work, I returned full force and feel that it gave me a new sense of confidence and purpose. This may differ from your experience being that I was a very fresh grad when I got pregnant with little experience out of school, but I think that you having a few years under your belt gives you an added advantage. 

Regarding whether motherhood has changed my outlook on my career and life, the answer is yes. During school and my first few months out, I was dedicated to the grind and didn’t mind staying late or putting in the extra hours. Now, I ensure that I am efficient during my day and set strict boundaries to leave work at a certain time. I still only get to see my son for about 1-2 hours when I get home to put him to bed. While this truly sucks during the workdays, I appreciate the time spent together so much more on my days off. The time feels more meaningful and I know that my son will one day understand that his mom was out there working hard for him to have a better life. 

That being said, if I had the opportunity to work part time or full time but three days a week for a similar salary, I would absolutely take it. I am interested in having more kids so we’ll see if all of this holds true!

3215,marwil20,"I'm curious how you've got the numbers for the vet school in the UK? Taking Edinburgh as an example, as that's where I study, tuition for starting next year is 37,500 fixed for the entire 5 years (this varies between schools). 

For living expenses, I would say that I spend less than £10,000 per year, including paying for flights to and from home in the US. That being said, I only go home once per year, round trip flight costing about $800.

Between those two figures the total cost (in GBP) is £237500, which at today's exchange rate is about $299,106.83. Taking into account the comment regarding lost earnings, this would push you even further towards coming to the UK. Obviously, the costs will vary between schools, Edinburgh is (I believe) cheaper for tuition, but a medium-high COL, Glasgow and London being far more expensive.

I know that you wanted to consider the financial aspects of this choice, but I would also urge you to consider the other aspects of the individual institutions you're applying to. The UK vet degree is an undergrad degree - you get to do societies and sports much more than a US vet degree. I might be biased, but I also think that the education process in the UK is much more collaborative between staff and students than in the US.

9 times out of 10, they are correct.  

As a new doctor that never did any GP and went right into ER from day one, I can't tell you how invaluable those techs were to me.

Having said that, there are techs that think they know it all.  Those may or may not have years of experience under their belt.  
I was pretty good at figuring out those that *thought* they knew a lot from those that actually did know a lot.  The former? I would just give a bit of a nod too and then proceed to ignore their advice.  The latter?  I would seriously consider their input.

Personally, I ask all my techs and fellow docs to call me by first name.  Yeah...yeah... I know I *earned* the right to be called Doctor but it always feels hierarchical and I like my nurses to feel uninhibited about coming to me for anything.  Clients always call me doctor.

Having said that, if the protocol there is for the nurses to refer to doctors as ""doctor"" (or if that was your preference) and that one nurse was refusing to call you doctor, I would be having a discussion with the lead nurse about it; assuming I asked the offending nurse to call me doctor and it went nowhere.

Even if the school is cheaper than the US would the cost of moving to another country cancel out the money I would save?

3260,Woman_WoahMan,"Background: I’m an undergrad (Junior year) currently majoring in English but planning to go to veterinary school! I completed most of my basic pre-reqs (gen chem, orgo, biology) with fairly good grades. I’m planning on completing a post bacc to complete the other science credits I need. I haven’t had a lot of extracurricular vet experience during school —- I attend a pretty intense college and have been managing some mental health struggles. My STEM GPA is 3.1 currently, and my overall GPA is 3.6. I did complete a summer internship at an equine rescue/rehab, and worked for a summer at a vet clinic in high school. I grew up with tons of animals!
Questions:
How do you gain veterinary experience with a non-stem major? Where/when can you start?
What do vet schools think about gap years? (I’m planning to take some time off and do/learn about other things I love — farming, backpacking, travel — before vet school.)
What can you do as a vet beyond small animal or equine? Are there positions that allow you to travel and/or help places without many vets, kind of like Doctors Without Borders? 
Is work/life balance pretty impossible? :/

In the former, enormous effort is taken to show respect and deference for the life and experience of the animal and the owner with whom they have a relationship.  In the latter, the lack of such respect is much harder for me- there's much more internal emotional friction. 

Every time I've had a particularly difficult euth and have shown personal emotion in front of owners, they have only taken it positively. They clearly take it as a validation of the relationship they have with their pet, validation of their current emotional response to losing their pet, and so on.

3267,Highly_Sugared,"Veterinary practice: How do I go about it?

Hi, my name is Leonardo, and my absolute dream job is to be a DVM. I've been doing a lot of research but I thought I'd ask first hand for some of my questions as it's a little difficult to find in things like articles. I am currently a freshman in highschool and have started animal science as my CTE. I assumed this would be the right path to go since it's focused mainly around veterinary practice. I live on a ranch with my family, which is mainly what aspired me to want to go into the veterinary feild; that and my compassion for animals in general.

1. My main struggle is college as I can't find any clear answers on how that works. It seems that it's all variables which I'm having a hard time comprehending. If someone could clearly explain that in a more step-by-step format it would probably help as most of the articals I read are very long-winded and hard to understand.

2. Anytime I try reading about the process of entering the veterinary feild it's almost discouraging as everything ends with 'It's not worth it'. All I hear about it how terrible the student loan debt is and that most vets live miserably. Is it not worth it to enter the veterinary feild?

3. Just how rough are the student loans and is there any way to dampen them even just a bit? I have a job working at one of my local restaurants that pays well enough for a minimum wage job and I plan on saving as much of that as I can for college. 

4. Is there a specific course you have to take for large animal veterinary medicine (cows, goats, horses, etc.) or is it also taught alongside small animal veterinary medicine? This one also confuses me because it seems there not exactly a clear answer here either.

3270,Unhappy_Passenger_86,"As some one who is also coming from a difficult situation and trying to pursue vet school, I have the greatest amount of empathy for you and your situation. I had my son my sophomore year of college and being practically homeless made it really difficult. I worked full time, took care of my son and just tried to barely survive. My end GPA at my undergrad school was 2.89. so I completely understand that low grades can be hard to come back from. 
I share this because I have gone on to get waitlisted at a vet school and this year I have again gotten interviews and a chance to go. Look at each vet school before you write yourself off and see what their requirements are and how they calculate GPA. I put mine into a Google doc so it was easy to read. I then looked VERY critically at my own academic experience and matched all the classes I had taken and their grades with the prereqs of each school.  A lot of schools (not all) out more weight on last 45 (semester credits, 60 quarter credits) than on overall GPA. If you can show in your last 45-60 credits that you were able to turn your grades around, it makes a really compelling case for you GPA wise. As for the DUI, I would be honest but not overly ""woah is me"" when it comes to discussing it.  They are not robots and the admissions people are generally awesome to talk to. So go into it with a growth mindset. ""I messed up, but here is what I learned and how I am taking steps in the future to keep it from happening again."" 
Diverse experiences and lots of hours will also help your case. If you look at your experience and see you don't have large animal or research, try to find ways to really get as much variety and length of hours as you can. I work in the research field, so my hours there number over 10k, but I had never worked in private practice, so I called every vet practice I could reasonably get to and found one that let me shadow. If you love wildlife, get involved at a wildlife rehab place and show that you really do want to be in that field, or become a zoo volunteer. Your past is only a fraction of who you are. Spend the vet school application showing them who you are now, and take steps to prove you have what it takes. Best of luck to you in your current and future endeavors!
